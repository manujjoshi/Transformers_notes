Multi-Sequence Positioning (MSP) method for large-scale stationary sensor node localization in outdoor environments.', 'Starting from a basic MSP design, we propose four optimizations, which work together to increase the localization accuracy.', 'It also provides a nice tradeoff between physical cost (anchors) and soft cost (events), while maintaining localization accuracy.', 'Previous research on node localization falls into two categories: range-based approaches and range-free approaches.', 'Realizing the impracticality of existing solutions for the large-scale outdoor environment, researchers have recently proposed solutions (e.g., Spotlight [20] and Lighthouse [18]) for sensor node localization using the spatiotemporal correlation of controlled events (i.e., inferring nodes\" locations based on the detection time of controlled events).', 'These solutions demonstrate that long range and high accuracy localization can be achieved simultaneously with little additional cost at sensor nodes.', 'We argue that precise event distribution is difficult to achieve, especially at large scale when terrain is uneven, the event distribution device is not well calibrated and its position is difficult to maintain (e.g., the helicopter-mounted scenario in [20]).', 'To address these limitations in current approaches, in this paper we present a multi-sequence positioning (MSP) method 15 for large-scale stationary sensor node localization, in deployments where an event source has line-of-sight to all sensors.', 'We demonstrate that making full use of the information embedded in one-dimensional node sequences can significantly improve localization accuracy.', 'Interestingly, we discover that repeated reprocessing of one-dimensional node sequences can further increase localization accuracy.', '• We propose a distribution-based location estimation strategy that obtains the final location of sensor nodes using the marginal probability of joint distribution among adjacent nodes within the sequence.', '• To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to improve the localization accuracy of nodes by adaptive events.', 'The generation of later events is guided by localization results from previous events.', 'Section 3 presents an overview of the MSP localization system.', 'Range-based localization systems, such as GPS [23], Cricket [17], AHLoS [19], AOA [16], Robust Quadrilaterals [13] and Sweeps [7], are based on fine-grained point-topoint distance estimation or angle estimation to identify pernode location.', 'The recently proposed RIPS localization system [11] superimposes two RF waves together, creating a low-frequency envelope that can be accurately measured.', 'In Spotlight [20], the event distribution needs to be precise in both time and space.', 'Precise event distribution is difficult to achieve without careful calibration, especially when the event-generating devices require certain mechanical maneuvers (e.g., the telescope mount used in Spotlight).', 'All these increase system cost and reduce localization speed.', 'In addition, this system does not require a rigid time-space relationship for the localization events, which is critical but hard to achieve in controlled event distribution scenarios (e.g., Spotlight [20]).', 'The results we have obtained empirically indicate that the implementation of the first two methods can dramatically reduce the localization error, and that the third and fourth methods are helpful for some system deployments.', 'Evaluation results in Section 8 will show that iterative MSP contributes noticeably to a lower localization error.', 'The distributions of each node under the ith scan (for the ith node sequence) are estimated in node.vmap[i], which is a data structure for remembering the marginal distribution over scan i.', 'In adaptive MSP, we carefully generate each new localization event so as to maximize the contribution of the new event to the refinement of localization, based on feedback from previous events.', 'Through previous localization events, the whole map has been partitioned into many small location areas.', 'The idea of adaptive MSP is to generate the next localization event to achieve best-effort elimination, which ideally could shrink the location area of individual node as much as possible.', 'We use a weighted voting mechanism to evaluate candidate localization events.', 'In other words, an optimal scan event cuts an area in the middle, since this cut shrinks the area quickly and thus reduces localization uncertainty quickly.', 'We show later that adaptive MSP improves localization accuracy in WSNs with irregularly shaped deployment areas.', 'The only thing the system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval between two successive localization events.', 'The parameter that affects the localization event generation here is the source location of the event.', 'Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave propagation scenario.', '21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect localization events.', 'This problem has two versions: • Anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence If some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization events, then the system has fewer anchors.', 'First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup localization approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP.', 'Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more localization events need to be launched.', 'Then, when the node detects the localization event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes.', 'In the left side of Figure 13(a), suppose node 1 and node 2 are so close to each other that it takes less than 0.5ms for the localization event to propagate from node 1 to node 2.', 'Sequence Flip and Protection Band Another problem is not fatal but lowers the localization accuracy.', 'The width of a protection band B, is largely determined by the maximum error in system time synchronization and the localization event propagation speed.', 'By adding the protection band, we reduce the chances of fatal errors, although at the cost of localization accuracy.', '• Adaptive Scan: The slope of each scan is determined based on the localization results from previous scans.', 'We intend to illustrate the impact of the number of anchors M, the number of scans d, and target node density (number of target nodes N in a fixed-size region) on the localization error.', 'Figure 14(a) indicates the following: (i) as the number of scans increases, the localization error decreases significantly; for example, localization errors drop more than 60% from 3 scans to 30 scans; (ii) statistically, regular scan achieves better performance than random scan under identical number of scans.', 'The results shown in Figure 14(b) indicate that (i) as the number of anchor nodes increases, the localization error decreases, and (ii) statistically, regular scan obtains better results than random scan with identical number of anchors.', 'Results in Figure 14(c) show that mean localization errors remain constant across different node densities.', 'Figure 17 presents cumulative distribution localization errors.', 'However, if the shape of the area is not regular, adaptive MSP helps to choose the appropriate localization events to compensate.', 'For example, adaptive MSP improves localization accuracy by 30% when the number of target nodes is 10.', '8.6 Simulation Summary Starting from basic MSP, we have demonstrated step-bystep how four optimizations can be applied on top of each other to improve localization performance.', 'Similarly, Figures 23(b) and 23(c) show the double-edged effects of protection band on the localization accuracy.', 'With 11 anchors we can achieve a localization accuracy as low as 0.25 ∼ 0.35 feet, which is nearly a 60% improvement.', 'Figure 27 shows the localization results using iterative MSP (3 times iterative processing) with a protection band of 3 feet.', 'The average error of the localization results is 3 feet and the maximum error is 5 feet with one un-localized node.', 'We demonstrated that we could significantly improve localization accuracy by making full use of the information embedded in multiple easy-to-get one-dimensional node sequences.', 'We proposed four novel optimization methods, exploiting order and marginal distribution among non-anchor nodes as well as the feedback information from early localization results.'], [' StarDust: A Flexible Architecture for Passive Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks ∗ Radu Stoleru, Pascal Vicaire, Tian He†, John A.

location accuracy, energy expenditure and the duration of the localization phase.', 'In this paper we propose a framework, called StarDust, for wireless sensor network localization based on passive optical components.', 'An image processing algorithm is developed for obtaining the locations of sensor nodes.', 'We propose and develop localization techniques based on four types of constraints: node color, neighbor information, deployment time for a node and deployment location for a node.', 'We evaluate the performance of a localization system based on our framework by localizing a network of 26 sensor nodes deployed in a 120 × 60 ft2 area.', 'The localization accuracy ranges from 2 ft to 5 ft while the localization time ranges from 10 milliseconds to 2 minutes.', 'Among these open problems is sensor node localization, i.e., how to find the physical position of each sensor node.', 'Despite the attention the localization problem in WSN has received, no universally acceptable solution has been developed.', 'On one hand, localization schemes that use ranging are typically high end solutions.', 'Ultrasound has a short range and is highly directional.', 'On the other hand, localization schemes that only use the connectivity information for inferring location information are characterized by low accuracies: ≈ 10 ft in controlled environments, 40−50 ft in realistic ones.', 'To address these challenges, we propose a framework for WSN localization, called StarDust, in which the complexity associated with the node localization is completely removed from the sensor node.', 'The basic principle of the framework is localization through passivity: each sensor node is equipped with a corner-cube retro-reflector and possibly an optical filter (a coloring device).', 'An aerial vehicle projects light onto the deployment area and records images containing retro-reflected light beams (they appear as luminous spots).', 'Through image processing techniques, the locations of the retro-reflectors (i.e., sensor nodes) is deter57 mined.', 'For inferring the identity of the sensor node present at a particular location, the StarDust framework develops a constraint-based node ID relaxation algorithm.', 'We propose a novel framework for node localization in WSNs that is very promising and allows for many future extensions and more accurate results.',

and very fast localization systems.', 'We develop a sensor node hardware prototype, called a SensorBall.', 'We evaluate the performance of a localization system for which we obtain location accuracies of 2 − 5 ft with a localization duration ranging from 10 milliseconds to 2 minutes.', 'We investigate the range of a system built on our framework by considering realities of physical phenomena that occurs during light propagation through the atmosphere.', 'One implementation and its performance evaluation are in Sections 4 and 5, followed by a suite of system optimization techniques, in Section 6.', '2 Related Work We present the prior work in localization in two major categories: the range-based, and the range-free schemes.', 'The range-based localization techniques have been designed to use either more expensive hardware (and hence higher accuracy) or just the radio transceiver.', 'The ToF localization technique that is most widely used is the GPS.', 'GPS is a costly solution for a high accuracy localization of a large scale sensor network.', 'The Cricket location-support system (TDoA) [7] can achieve a location granularity of tens of inches with highly directional and short range ultrasound transceivers.', 'The localization problem is formulated as an on-line state estimation in a nonlinear dynamic system [11].', 'A very recent, remarkable, localization technique is based on radio interferometry, RIPS [13], which utilizes two transmitters to create an interfering signal.', 'The long time required for localization and multi-path environments pose significant challenges.', 'Real environments create additional challenges for the range based localization schemes.', 'To address these challenges, and others (hardware cost, the energy expenditure, the form factor, the small range, localization time), several range-free localization schemes have been proposed.', 'Sensor nodes use primarily connectivity information for inferring proximity to a set of anchors.', 'In the Centroid localization scheme [17], a sensor node localizes to the centroid of its proximate beacon nodes.', 'More recently, several localization schemes that exploit the sensing capabilities of sensor nodes, have been proposed.', 'A sensor node detects the light beam for a period of time, which is dependent on the distance between it and the light emitting device.', 'Many of the above localization solutions target specific sets of requirements and are useful for specific applications.', 'StarDust is meant for localizing air dropped nodes where node passiveness, high accuracy, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are all required.', 'The main difficulty when applying the above ideas to the real world is the complexity of the hardware that needs to be put on a sensor node so that the emitted light can be detected from thousands of feet.', 'Instead, what we propose to use for sensor node localization is a passive optical element called a retro-reflector.', '3.1 System Architecture The envisioned sensor network localization scenario is as follows: • The sensor nodes are released, possibly in a controlled manner, from an aerial vehicle during the night.', '• The aerial vehicle hovers over the deployment area and uses a strobe light to illuminate it.', '• The aerial vehicle records a sequence of two images very close in time (msec level).', '• The aerial vehicle executes the mapping of node IDs to the identified locations in one of the following ways: a) by using the color of a retro-reflected light, if a sensor node has a

when no illuminations is present.', 'Standard computer graphics techniques [23] are then used to transform the 2D locations of sensor nodes detected in multiple images into 3D sensor node locations.', '3.3 Node ID Matching The goal of the Node ID Matching module is to obtain the identity (node ID) of a luminous spot in the image, detected to be a sensor node.', 'For this, we define V = {(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xm,ym)} to be the set of locations of the sensor nodes, as detected by the Image Processing module and Λ = {λ1,λ2,...,λm} to be the set of unique node IDs assigned to the m

each object detected in an image, such that an appropriate image interpretation is achieved.', 'The main idea of the sensor node localization through probabilistic label relaxation is to iteratively compute the probability of each label being the correct label for a sensor node, by taking into account, at each iteration, the support for a label.', 'Formally, the algorithm is outlined in Algorithm

Qs ni (λk) is: Qs ni (λk) = support for label λk of node ni (4) The label relaxation algorithm is iterative and it is polynomial in the size of the network(number of nodes).', 'At each iteration s, the algorithm updates the probability associated with each label, by considering the Support Qs ni (λk) for each candidate label of a sensor node.', 'While some of these techniques are simplistic, they are primitives which, when combined, can create powerful localization systems.', '3.3.1 Relaxation with Color Constraints The unique mapping between a sensor node\"s position (identified by the image processing) and a label can be obtained by assigning a unique color to each sensor node.', 'This mapping is known prior to the sensor node deployment (from node manufacturing).', 'In the case of color constrained label relaxation, the support for label λk is expressed as follows: Qs ni (λk) = 1 (5) As a result, the label relaxation algorithm (Algorithm 2) consists of the following steps: one label is assigned to each sensor node (lines 1-3 of the algorithm), implicitly having a probability Pni(λk) = 1 ; the algorithm executes a single iteration, when the support function, simply, reiterates the confidence in the unique labeling.', 'It is interesting to discuss here the influence that the size of the coloring space (i.e., |C|) has on the accuracy of the localization algorithm.', 'From the image processing system, the position of sensor nodes can still be obtained.', 'Since all nodes appear white, no single sensor node can be uniquely identified.', 'One can observe that once a color is assigned uniquely to a sensor node, in effect, that sensor node is given the status of anchor, or node with known location.', 'It is interesting to observe that there is an entire spectrum of possibilities for how to partition the set of sensor nodes in equivalence classes (where an equivalence class is represented by one color), in order to maximize the success of the localization algorithm.', 'One of the goals of this paper is to understand how the size of the coloring space and its partitioning affect localization accuracy.', 'In order to gather connectivity information, the following need to occur: 1) after deployment, through beaconing of HELLO messages, sensor nodes build their neighborhood tables; 2) each node sends its neighbor table information to the Central device via a base station.', 'First, let us define G = (Λ,E) to be the weighted connectivity graph built by the Central device from the received neighbor table information.', 'Label relaxation with connectivity constraints weight gij represented by the number of beacons sent by λj and received by λi.', 'In addition, let R be the radio range of the sensor nodes.', 'The main idea of the connectivity constrained label relaxation is depicted in Figure 4 in which two nodes ni and nj have been assigned all possible labels.', 'The support for the label λk of sensor node ni, resulting from the interaction (i.e., within radio range) with sensor node nj is given by: Qs ni (λk) = M ∑ m=1 gλkλm Ps nj (λm) (6) As a result, the localization algorithm (Algorithm 3 consists of the following steps: all labels are assigned to each sensor node (lines 1-3 of the algorithm), and implicitly each label has a probability initialized to Pni(λk) = 1/|Λ|; in each iteration, the probabilities for the labels of a sensor node are updated, when considering the interaction with the labels of sensor nodes within R. It is important to remark that the identity of the nodes within R is not known, only the candidate labels and their probabilities.', 'The relaxation algorithm converges when, during an iteration, the probability of no label is updated by more than ε.', 'The label relaxation algorithm based on connectivity constraints, enforces such constraints between pairs of sensor nodes.', 'Hence, the algorithm should only consider pairs of sensor nodes that are within a reasonable communication range (R).', 'We assume a circular radio range and a symmetric connectivity.', 'In the remaining part of the section we propose a simple analytical model that estimates the radio range R for medium-connected networks (less than 20 neighbors per R).', 'We consider the following to be known: the size of the deployment field (L), the number of sensor nodes deployed (N) Algorithm 3 Localization 1: Estimate the radio range R 2: Execute the Label Relaxation Algorithm with Support Function given by Equation 6 for neighbors less than R apart 3: for each sensor node ni do 4: node identity is λk with max.', 'For our analysis, we uniformly distribute the sensor nodes in a square area of length L, by using a grid of unit length L/ √ N.

the wind speed V [25] [26], we can obtain the probability distribution of D under a given wind speed distribution.', 'As shown in Figure 5, the spatial-based relaxation is a recursive process to assign the probability that a nodes has a certain label by using the distances between the location of a node with multiple label locations.', 'We note that the distribution of distance D affects the probability with which a label is assigned.', 'More formally, given a probability density function PDF(D), the support for label λk of sensor node ni can be formulated as: Qs ni (λk) = PDF(Dni λk )

iteration of the localization algorithm for node ni, assuming that node nj is the first wi chosen in line 7 of Algorithm 3.', 'One interesting problem, which we explore in the performance evaluation section, is to assess the impact the partitioning of the color set C has on the accuracy of localization.', 'When the size of the coloring set is smaller than the number of sensor nodes (as it is the case for our hybrid connectivity/color constrained relaxation), the system designer has the option of allowing one node to uniquely have a color (acting as an anchor), or multiple nodes.', 'For our analysis of the trade-offs, we consider the following metrics of interest: the localization time (duration), the energy consumed (overhead), the network size (scale) that can be handled by the technique and the localization accuracy.', 'The parameters of interest are the following: the number of sensor nodes (N), the energy spent for one aerial drop (εd), the energy spent in the network for collecting and reporting neighbor information εb and the time Td taken by a sensor node to reach the ground after being aerially deployed.', 'As shown, the relaxation techniques based on color and space constraints have the lowest localization duration, zero, for all practical purposes.', 'Comparison of label relaxation techniques 4 System Implementation The StarDust localization framework, depicted in Figure 2, is flexible in that it enables the development of new localization systems, based on the four proposed label relaxation schemes, or the inclusion of other, yet to be invented,

implementation of the StarDust localization framework.', 'The three major research questions that our evaluation tries to answer are: the feasibility of the proposed framework (can sensor nodes be optically detected at large distances), the localization accuracy of one actual implementation of the StarDust framework, and whether or not atmospheric conditions can affect the recognition of sensor nodes in an image.', 'We wanted to evaluate the performance of the Image Processing Algorithm in a long range, realistic, experimental set-up, while the Node ID Matching required a relatively large area, available for long periods of time (for connectivity data gathering).', 'For the evaluation of the Node ID Mapping component, we deploy 26 sensor nodes in an 120 × 60 ft2 flat area of a stadium.', 'In order to investigate the influence the radio connectivity has on localization accuracy, we vary the height above ground of the deployed sensor nodes.', 'From here on, we will refer to these two experimental set-ups as the low connectivity and the high connectivity networks, respectively because when nodes are on the ground the communication range is low resulting in less neighbors than when the nodes are elevated and have a greater communication range.', 'The metrics of interest are: the localization error (defined as the distance between the computed location and the true location - known from the manual placement), the percentage of nodes correctly localized, the convergence of the label relaxation algorithm, the time to localize and the robustness of the node ID mapping to errors in the Image Processing module.', 'The parameters that we vary in simulations (subsequent to image acquisition and connectivity collection) the number of colors, the number of

for the low connectivity network of 180 beacons and for the high connectivity network of 420 beacons.', 'From our Radio Model (Equation 7, we obtain a radio range R = 25 ft for the low connectivity network and R = 40 ft for the high connectivity network.', 'We define the average radio range R to be the distance over which less than 20% of potential radio links, are missing.', 'As shown in Figure 15, the radio range is between 20 ft and 25 ft. For the higher connectivity network, the radio range was between 30 ft and 40 ft. We choose two conservative estimates of the radio range: 20 ft for the low connectivity case and 35 ft for the high connectivity case, which are in good agreement with the values predicted by our Radio Model.', '5.2.2 Localization Error vs. Coloring Space Size In this experiment we investigate the effect of the number of colors on the localization accuracy.', 'Percentage of nodes correctly localized We then execute the localization algorithm, which uses the empirical data.', 'The algorithm is run for three different radio ranges: 15, 20 and 25 ft, to investigate its influence on the localization error.', 'As shown, for an estimate of 20 ft for the radio range (as predicted by our Radio Model) we obtain the smallest localization errors, as small as 2 ft, when enough colors are used.', 'If the algorithm does not converge in a predetermined number of steps, it will terminate and the label with the highest probability will provide the identity of the node.', '5.2.3 Localization Error vs. Color Uniqueness As mentioned in the Section 3.3.1, a unique color gives a sensor node the statute of an anchor.', 'A sensor node that is an anchor can unequivocally be identified through the Image Processing module.', 'In this section we investigate the effect unique colors have on the localization accuracy.', 'Specifically, we want to experimentally verify our intuition that assigning more nodes to a color can benefit the localization accuracy, by enforcing more constraints, as opposed to uniquely assigning a color to a single node.', 'The experimental results are depicted in Figure 20 (localization error) and Figure 21 (percentage of sensor node correctly localized).', 'As expected, the localization accuracy increases with the increase in the number of colors available (larger coloring space).', 'Also, for a given size of the coloring space (e.g., 6 colors available), if more colors are uniquely assigned to sensor nodes then the localization accuracy decreases.', 'Specifically, if 8 colors are available and all are assigned uniquely, the system would be less accurately localized (error ≈ 7 ft), when compared to the case of 6 colors and no unique assignments of colors (≈ 5 ft localization error).', 'The same trend, of a less accurate localization can be observed in Figure 21, which shows the percentage of nodes correctly localized (i.e., 0 ft localization error).', '5.2.4 Localization Error vs. Connectivity We collected empirical data for two network deployments with different degrees of connectivity (high and low) in order to assess the influence of connectivity on location accuracy.', 'The results obtained from running our localization algorithm are depicted in Figure 22 and Figure 23.', 'In both scenarios, as expected, localization error decrease with an increase in the number of colors.', 'It is interesting to observe, however, that the low connectivity scenario im67 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 4 6 8 Number

number of colors available.', 'When the number of colors becomes relatively large (twelve for our 26 sensor node network), both scenarios (low and high connectivity) have comparable localization errors, of less that 2 ft.', 'The same trend of more accurate location information is evidenced by Figure 23 which shows that the percentage of nodes that are localized correctly grows quicker for the low connectivity deployment.', 'Image Processing Errors So far we investigated the sources for error in localization that are intrinsic to the Node ID Matching component.', 'More problematic are false negatives (when a sensor node does not reflect back enough light to be detected).', 'They need to be handled by the localization algorithm.', 'In this case, the localization algorithm is presented with two sets of nodes of different sizes, that need to be matched: one coming from the Image Processing (which misses some nodes) and one coming from the network, with the connectivity information (here we assume a fully connected network, so that all sensor nodes report their connectivity information).', 'In this experiment we investigate how Image Processing errors (false negatives) influence the localization accuracy.', 'For this evaluation, we ran our localization algorithm with empirical data, but dropped a percentage of nodes from the list of nodes detected by the Image Processing

deployed from 2,400 ft (necessary for the time-constrained relaxation) and that the time required for reporting connectivity grows linearly, with an initial reporting period of 160sec, as used in a real world tracking application [1].', 'The localization duration results, as presented in Table 1, are depicted in Figure 25.', 'The same applies to the color constrained relaxation, for which the localization time is 0sec (if the number of colors is sufficient).', 'The localization duration for all other network sizes (100, 150 and 200) is infinite (i.e., unique color assignments to sensor

section we evaluate the feasibility of the StarDust localization framework when considering the realities of light propagation through the atmosphere.', 'The main factor that determines the range of our system is light scattering, which redirects the luminance of the source into the medium (in essence equally affecting the luminosity of the target and of the background).', 'Scattering limits the visibility range by reducing the apparent contrast between the target and its background (approaches zero, as the distance increases).', 'It is important to remark that when Cr reaches its lower limit, no increase in the source luminance or receiver sensitivity will increase the range of the system.', 'From Equations 11 and 12 it can be observed that the parameter which can be controlled and can influence the range of the system is ρt, the target reflectance.', 'For a contrast C of at least 0.5, as it can be seen in Figure 26 a range of approximately 4,500 ft can be achieved if the atmosphere is clear.', 'The performance dramatically deteriorates, when the atmospheric conditions are problematic.', 'As shown in Figure 27 a range of up to 1,500 ft is achievable, when using highly reflective CCR components.', 'While our light source (3 million candlepower) was sufficient for a range of a few hundred feet, we remark that there exist commercially available light sources (20 million candlepower) or military (150 million candlepower [27]), powerful enough for ranges of a few thousand feet.', '6.3 Localization in Rugged Environments The initial driving force for the StarDust localization framework was to address the sensor node localization in extremely rugged environments.', 'The hope, and our original idea, was to consider the time period between the aerial deployment and the time when the sensor node disappears under the canopy.', 'By recording the last visible position of a sensor node (as seen from the aircraft) a reasonable estimate of the sensor node location can be obtained.', 'Nevertheless, we remark on the suitability of our localization framework for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments.', '7 Conclusions StarDust solves the localization problem for aerial deployments where passiveness, low cost, small form factor and rapid localization are required.', 'Results show that accuracy can be within 2 ft and localization time within milliseconds.', 'We predict the influence the atmospheric conditions can have on the range of a system based on the StarDust framework, and show that hazy environments or daylight can pose significant challenges.', 'Most importantly, the properties of StarDust support the potential for even more accurate localization solutions as well as solutions for rugged, non-line-of-sight environments.', '[3]

the various components of a multi-tier sensor network assumed in our work.', '2.1 System Model We envision a multi-tier sensor network comprising multiple tiers - a bottom tier of untethered remote sensor nodes, a middle tier of tethered sensor proxies, and an upper tier of applications and user terminals (see Figure 1).', 'To support such queries, the system needs to archive data on a persistent store.', 'For maximum network life a sensor storage system should leverage the flash memory on sensors to archive data locally, substituting cheap memory operations for expensive radio transmission.', 'The goal of the interval skip graph is to index all intervals such that the set that overlaps a query interval can be located efficiently.', 'In the rest of this section, we describe the interval skip graph in greater detail.', 'Although the resulting structure is not perfectly balanced, following the analysis in [23] we can show that the probability of it being significantly out of balance is extremely small; in addition, since the structure is determined by the random number stream, input data patterns cannot cause the tree to become imbalanced.', 'The interval skip graph is constructed by applying the method of augmented search trees, as described by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest [5] and applied to binary search trees to create an Interval Tree.', 'Insert Complexity: In an interval tree or interval skip list, the maximum value for an entry need only be calculated over the subtree rooted at that entry, as this value will be examined only when searching within the subtree rooted at that entry.', 'As may be in Section 3.2, insert and delete cost on an interval skip graph has a worst case complexity of O(n), compared to O(log n) for an interval tree.', '3.4 Alternative Data Structures Thus far we have only compared the sparse interval skip graph with similar structures from which it is derived.', 'Indexing locally using an appropriate singlenode

fact, DIMs could become an important component of a sensor network database system such as TinyDB [17].', 'Our work avoids query flooding by an appropriate choice of hashing.', 'A similar differentiation applies with respect to work on data-centric routing in sensor networks [15, 25], where data generated at a node is assumed to be stored at the node, and queries are either flooded

have discussed in Section 1, range queries can enable efficient correlation and triggering within the network.', 'The system we present in this paper, the DIM, relies upon two foundations: a locality-preserving geographic hash, and an underlying geographic routing scheme.', 'The basic insight underlying DIM is that data locality can be obtained by a locality-preserving geographic hash

'3.3.4 Summary and Pseudo-code In summary, our event insertion procedure is designed to nicely interact with the zone discovery mechanism, and the event hashing mechanism.', 'The latter two mechanisms are kept simple, while the event insertion mechanism uses lazy evaluation at each hop to refine the event\"s zone code, and it leverages GPSR\"s perimeter walking mechanism to fix undecided zone boundaries.', 'In Section 3.5, we address robustness of event insertion to packet loss or to node failures.', 'In a dense sensor network, the local replica of a node is usually very near to the node,

people in emergency situations in wilderness areas.', 'A key feature of CenWits is that it does not require a continuously connected sensor network for its operation.', 'It is designed for an intermittently connected network that provides only occasional connectivity.', 'It makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing

base stations, or mobile devices.', 'This requirement severely limits their applicability, particularly in remote wilderness areas where maintaining a connected network is very difficult.', 'While a satellite transmitter is the only viable solution in wilderness areas, it is typically expensive and cumbersome.', 'In fact, building an adhoc sensor network using only the sensors worn by hikers is nearly impossible due to a relatively small number of sensors spread over a large wilderness area.', 'In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a search and rescue system called CenWits (Connection-less Sensor-Based Tracking System Using Witnesses).', 'This averts a need for maintaining a connected network to transmit location information to the outside world.', 'In particular, it makes a judicious use of the combined storage capability of sensors to filter, organize and store important information, combined battery power of sensors to ensure that the system remains operational for longer time periods, and intermittent network connectivity to propagate information to a processing center.', 'The paper describes important techniques to combine memory, transmission and battery power of many sensors to address resource constraints in the context of a search and rescue application.', 'Instead, the main goal is to provide an approximate, small area where search and rescue efforts can be concentrated.', 'In Section 2, we overview some of the recent projects and technologies related to movement and location tracking, and search and rescue systems.', 'A location tracking system for adhoc sensor networks using anchor sensors as reference to gain location information and spread it out to outer node is proposed in [17].', 'Luxury version of PLB combines a GPS receiver and a COSPASSARSAT satellite transmitter that can transmit user\"s location in latitude and longitude to the rescue team whenever an accident happens [4].', 'It requires a satellite transmitter and a connected network.', 'Another disadvantage of luxury PLB is that a satellite transmitter is very expensive, costing in the range of $750.', 'Lifetch attempts to transmit the location information by GSM/GPRS and adhoc sensor network that uses AODV as the routing protocol.', 'CenWits solves one of the greatest problems plaguing modern search and rescue systems: it has an inherent on-site storage capability.', 'Each hiker wears a sensor (MICA2 motes in our prototype) equipped with a GPS receiver and an RF transmitter.', 'When any two sensors are in the range of one another, they record the presence of each other (witness information), and also exchange the witness information they recorded earlier.', 'Later on, if the hiker wearing one of these sensors is lost, the other sensor can convey the last known (witnessed) location of the lost hiker.', 'Furthermore, by exchanging the witness information that each sensor recorded earlier, the witness information is propagated beyond a direct contact between two sensors.', 'To convey witness information to a processing center or to a rescue team, access points are established at well-known locations that the hikers are expected to pass through, e.g.', 'Whenever a sensor node is in the vicinity of an access point, all witness information stored in that sensor is automatically dumped to the access point.', 'The witness information is downloaded to the processing center from various access points at regular intervals.', 'To estimate the speed, location and direction of a hiker at any point in time, all witness information of that hiker that has been collected from various access points is processed.', 'It uploads its recorded witness information and clears its memory.', 'For example, on a popular four-hour hike, a hiker might run into as many as 20 other hikers.', 'A slow hiker can go 1 mile (5,280 feet) per hour.', 'Thus in 12 minutes a slow hiker can go as far as 1056 feet.', 'So, for the sensors to form a sensor network on a 4-hour hiking trail, there should be at least 120 hikers scattered evenly.', 'Given a walking speed of one mile per hour (88 feet per minute) and Mica2 range of about 150 feet for non-line-of-sight radio transmission, two hikers have about 150/88 = 1.7 minutes to discover the presence of each other and exchange their witness information.', 'We therefore design our system to have each sensor emit a beacon every one-and-a-half minute.', 'In Figure 2, hiker B\"s sensor emits a beacon when A is in range, this triggers A to exchange data with B.', 'B goes

node receives a witness record from another node, it increments the hop count of that record by 1.', 'It keeps only those witness records in its memory, whose hop count is less than MAX HOP COUNT.',

high probability of being dumped at some AP as quickly as possible; and (2) To ensure that a witness record is stored only at a few nodes, so that it does not clog up too much of the combined memory

State University, Tallahassee, FL Email: {sudhir, banavar}@cs.fsu.edu Sarit Mukherjee Sampath Rangarajan Center for Networking Research Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ Email: {sarit, sampath}@bell-labs.com ABSTRACT In a distributed multi-player game that uses dead-reckoning vectors to exchange movement information among players, there is inaccuracy in rendering the objects at the receiver due to network delay between the sender and the receiver.', 'This algorithm makes the game very fair at the expense of increasing the overall mean error of all players.', 'To mitigate this effect, we propose a budget based algorithm that provides improved fairness without increasing the mean error thereby maintaining the accuracy of game playing.', 'We have implemented both the scheduling algorithm and the budget based algorithm as part of BZFlag, a popular distributed multi-player game.', 'We show through experiments that these algorithms provide fairness among players in spite of widely varying network delays.', 'An additional property of the proposed algorithms is that they require less number of DRs to be exchanged (compared to the current implementation of BZflag) to achieve the same level of accuracy in game playing.', 'INTRODUCTION In a distributed multi-player game, players are normally distributed across the Internet and have varying delays to each other or to a central game server.', 'DR vectors are quantization of the real trajectory (which we refer to as real path) at a player.', 'Because of the network delay between the sending and receiving players, when a DR vector is received and rendered at a player, the original trajectory of the player/entity may have already changed.', 'We refer to this error as the export error.', 'The export error manifests itself due to the deviation between the exported path at the sender and the placed path at the receiver (i) 1 before the DR vector is received at the receiver (referred to as the before export error, and (ii) after the DR vector is received at the receiver (referred to as the after export error).', 'In an earlier paper [1], we showed that by synchronizing the clocks at all the players and by using a technique based on time-stamping messages that carry the DR vectors, we can guarantee that the after export error is made zero.', 'We also showed that the before export error can never be eliminated since there is always a non-zero network delay, but can be significantly reduced using our technique [1].', 'Our goal in this paper is to improve the fairness of these games in spite of the varying network delays by equalizing the export error at the players.', 'We explore whether the time-average of the export errors (which is the cumulative export error over a period of time averaged over the time period) at all the players can be made the same by scheduling the sending of the DR vectors appropriately at the sender.', 'Both the algorithms are based on delaying (or dropping) the sending of DR vectors to some players on a continuous basis to try and make the export error the same at all the players.', 'At an abstract level, the algorithm delays sending DR vectors to players whose accumulated error so far in the game is smaller than others; this would mean that the export error due to this DR vector at these players will be larger than that of the other players, thereby making them the same.', 'The first algorithm (which we refer to as the scheduling algorithm) is based on estimating the delay between players and refining the sending of DR vectors by scheduling them to be sent to different players at different times at every DR generation point.', 'Through an implementation of this algorithm using the open source game BZflag, we show that this algorithm makes the game very fair (we measure fairness in terms of the standard deviation of the error).', 'To alleviate this effect, we propose a budget based algorithm which budgets how the DRs are sent to different players.', 'Experimental results from BZflag illustrates that the budget based algorithm follows a more balanced approach.', 'It improves the fairness of the game but at the same time does so without pushing up the mean error of the players thereby maintaining the accuracy of the game.', 'In addition, the budget based algorithm is shown to achieve the same level of accuracy of game playing as the current implementation of BZflag using much less number of DR vectors.', 'The online multi-player game MiMaze [2, 5, 6], for example, takes a static bucket synchronization approach to compensate for variable network delays.', 'Players with a network delay larger than 100 ms simply cannot participate in the game.', 'In general, techniques based on bucket synchronization depend on imposing a worst case delay on all the players.', 'There have been a few papers which have studied the problem of fairness in a distributed game by more sophisticated message delivery mechanisms.', 'It has been shown in [9] that multi-player games that use DR vectors together with bucket synchronization are not cheatproof unless additional mechanisms are put in place.', 'Both the scheduling algorithm and the budget-based algorithm described in our paper use DR vectors and hence are not cheat-proof.', 'We emphasize that the focus of this paper is on fairness without addressing the issue of cheating.', 'In Section 4, we describe the DR vector scheduling algorithm that aims to make the export error equal across the players with varying delays from the sender of a DR vector, followed by experimental results obtained from instrumentation of the scheduling algorithm on the open source game BZFlag.', 'Section 5, describes the budget based algorithm that achieves improved fairness but without reducing the level accuracy of game playing.', 'The deviation between the exported and placed paths creates an error component which we refer to as the export error.', 'A way to represent the export error is to compute the integral of the distance between the two trajectories over the time when they are out of sync.', 'In the figure, the export error due to DR1 is computed as the integral of the distance between the trajectories AC and BD over the time interval [T1, T1 + dt1].', 'Note that there could be other ways of representing this error as well, but in this paper, we use the integral of the distance between the two trajectories as a measure of the export error.', 'Note that there would have been an export error created due to the reception of DR0 at which time the placed path would have been based on a previous DR vector.', 'This is not shown in the figure but it serves to remind the reader that the export error is cumulative when a sequence of DR vectors are received.', 'As we discussed earlier, this export error is unavoidable.', 'Each of these players receives DR0 and DR1 after varying delays thereby creating different export error values at different players.', 'The goal of the DR vector scheduling algorithm to be described in the next section is to make this (cumulative) export error equal at every player independently for each of the entities that make up the game.', '3 vector to the receiver of the DR vector could lead to export error because of the deviation of the placed path from the exported path at the receiver until this new DR vector is received.', 'We also mentioned that the goal of the DR vector scheduling algorithm is to make the export error equal at all receivers over a period of time.', '4.1 Computation of Relative Export Error Referring back to the discussion from Section 3, from the sender\"s perspective, the export error at receiver 1 due to DR1 is given by Err(DR1, T1, T1 + δ1 + dt1) (the integral of the distance between the trajectories AC and DB over the time interval [T1, T1 + δ1 + dt1]) of Figure 2.', 'Similarly, the export error from the sender\"s perspective at received 2 due to DR1 is given by Err(DR1, T1, T1 + δ2 + dt2) (the integral of the distance between the trajectories AE and DF over the time interval [T1, T1 + δ2 + dt2]).', 'In reality, the export error will be either smaller or larger than the estimated value, based on whether the delay estimate was larger or smaller than the actual delay that DR1 experienced.', 'This difference between the estimated and the actual export error is the relative export error (which could either be positive or negative) which occurs for every DR vector that is sent and is accumulated at the sender.', 'The concept of relative export error is illustrated in Figure 2.', 'Since the actual delay to receiver 1 is da1, the export error induced by DR1 at receiver 1 is Err(DR1, T1, T1 + δ1 + da1).', 'This means, there is an error in the estimated export error and the sender can compute this error only after it gets a feedback from the receiver about the actual delay for the delivery of DR1, i.e., the value of da1.', 'Therefore, the sender computes the relative export error for receiver 1, represented using R1 as R1 = Err(DR1, T1, T1 + δ1 + dt1) − Err(DR1, T1, T1 + δ1 + da1) = Err(DR1, T1 + δ1 + dt1, T1 + δ1 + da1) Similarly the relative export error for receiver 2 is computed as R2 = Err(DR1, T1, T1 + δ2 + dt2) − Err(DR1, T1, T1 + δ2 + da2) = Err(DR1, T1 + δ2 + dt2, T1 + δ2 + da2) Note that R1 > 0 as da1 < dt1, and R2 < 0 as da2 > dt2.', 'This example shows the 4 relative export error values after DR1 is sent and the corresponding feedbacks are received.', 'This method of computation of δ\"s ensures that the accumulated export error (i.e., total actual error) for each receiver equalizes at the transmission of each DR vector.', 'Then Ri m = Ai m −Si m. In order to compute the schedule instances (i.e., δ\"s) for Di, for any pair of receivers m and n, we do Ri−1 m + Si m = Ri−1 n + Si n. The following theorem establishes the fact that the accumulated export error is equalized at every scheduling instant.', 'In order to compute the schedule for Di+1, the we first compute the relative errors as Ri m = Ai m − Si m, and Ri n = Ai n − Si n. Then to compute δ\"s we execute Ri m + Si+1 m = Ri n + Si+1 n Ai m − Si m + Si+1 m = Ai n − Si n + Si+1 n . Adding the condition of the premise on both sides we get, i k=1 Ak m + Si+1 m = i k=1 Ak n + Si+1 n . 4.3 Computation of the Export Error Let us now consider how the export errors can be computed.', 'As discussed earlier, because the sender is not able to a priori learn the delay, there will always be an accumulated relative export error from a previous DR vector that does have to be taken into account.', 'To delve deeper into this, consider the computation of the export error as illustrated in the previous section.', 'To make the game as fast as possible within this framework, the δ values should be made as small as possible so that DR vectors are sent to the receivers as soon as possible subject to the fairness requirement.', '4.5 Steps of the Scheduling Algorithm For the purpose of the discussion below, as before let us denote the accumulated relative export error at a sender for receiver k up until DRi to be Ri k. Let us denote the scheduled delay at the sender before DRi is sent to receiver k as δi k. Given the above discussion, the algorithm steps are as follows: 1.', 'For such a receiver j, when DRi+1 is to be scheduled and 6 timeTi Exported path dtj A B C D Ti-1 Gi j DRi+1 computed by sender and DRi for receiver k+1 to N is removed from queue DRi+1 scheduled for receiver k+1 Ti+1 G H E F DRi scheduled for receiver j DRi computed by sender Placed path at receiver k+1 Gi+1 j Figure 3: Schedule computation when DRi is not sent to receiver j, k + 1 ≤ j ≤ N. δi+1 j needs to be computed, the total export error is the accumulated relative export error at time Ti when schedule for DRi was computed, plus the integral of the distance between the two trajectories AC and BD of Figure 3 over the time interval [Ti, Ti+1 + δi+1 j + dtj].', 'Therefore, instead of Ei j of Equation (1), we use the value Ri−1 j + Err(DRi, Ti, Ti+1) + Err(DRi+1, Ti+1, Ti+1 + δi+1 j + dtj) where Ri−1 j is relative export error used when the schedule for DRi was computed.', '4.7 Experimental Results In order to evaluate the effectiveness and quantify benefits obtained through the use of the scheduling algorithm, we implemented the proposed algorithm in BZFlag (Battle Zone Flag) [11] game.', 'The sender also calculated the standard deviation and the mean of the accumulated export error of all the receivers every 100 milliseconds.', 'Figure 4 plots the mean and standard deviation of the accumulated export error of all the receivers in the scheduling case against the base case.', 'This shows that the scheduling approach achieves fairness among the receivers even if they are at different distances (i.e, latencies) from the sender.', 'The scheduling for fairness leads to the decrease in standard deviation (i.e., increases the fairness among different players), but it comes at the cost of higher mean error, which may not be a desirable feature.', 'Using the same amount of DR vectors over time as in the base case, instead of sending the DR vectors to all the receivers at the same frequency as in the base case, if we can increase the frequency of sending the DR vectors to the receiver with higher accumulated error and decrease the frequency of sending DR vectors to the receiver with lower accumulated error, we can equalize the export error of all receivers over time.', 'We refer to such an algorithm as a budget based algorithm.', 'Since the DR vectors are sent to all the receivers and the network delay between the sender-receiver pairs cannot be avoided, the before export error 3 with the most distant player will always 3 Note that after export error is eliminated by using synchronized clock among the players.', 'The budget based algorithm is based on this idea and there are two variations of it.', 'To compare the probabilistic budget based algorithm with the base case, we needed to lower the threshold for the base case (for fair comparison).', 'As the dead reckoning threshold in the base case was already very fine, it was decided that instead of lowering the threshold, the probabilistic budget based approach would be compared against a modified base case that would use the normal threshold as the budget based algorithm but the base case was modified such that every third trigger would be actually used to send out a DR vector to all the three receivers used in our experiments.', 'Observe from the figures that the standard deviation of the accumulated error among the receivers with the probabilistic budget based algorithm is less than the 1/3 base case and the mean is a little higher than the 1/3 base case.', 'This implies that the game is fairer as compared to the 1/3 base case at the cost of increasing the mean error by a small amount as compared to the 1/3 base case.', 'The increase in mean error in the probabilistic case compared to the 1/3 base case can be attributed to the fact that the even though the probabilistic approach on average sends the same number of DR vectors as the 1/3 base case, it sometimes sends DR vectors to a receiver less frequently and sometimes more frequently than the 1/3 base case due to its probabilistic nature.', '8 0 200 400 600 800 1000 15950 16000 16050 16100 16150 16200 16250 16300

By delaying the update to local site, GS-DR-LL can achieve higher consistency than GS-DR.', 'The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives the definition of consistency and corresponding metrics; the cause of the inconsistency of DR is analyzed in Section 3; Section 4 describes how GS-DR-LL works; performance evaluation is presented in Section 5; Section 6 concludes the paper.', 'CONSISTENCY DEFINITIONS AND METRICS The consistency of replicated applications has already been well defined in discrete domain [9, 10, 11, 12], but few related work has been done in continuous domain.', 'Mauve et al [1] have given a definition of consistency for replicated applications in continuous domain, but the definition is based on operation transmission and it is difficult for the definition to describe state transmission based methods (e.g.', 'Here, we present an alternative definition of consistency in continuous domain, which suits state transmission based methods well.', 'Corresponding metrics are needed to measure the consistency of shared entities between local and remote sites.', 'De(i, j, t) can be used as a metric to measure the degree of consistency at a certain time point.', 'If De(i, j, t1) > De(i, j, t2), it can be stated that between sites i and j, the consistency of the states of entity e at time point t1 is lower than that at time point t2.', 'If De(i, j, t) > De(l, k, t), it can be stated that, at time point t, the consistency of the states of entity e between sites i and j is lower than that between sites l and k. Similarly, De(i, j, t1, t2) can been used as a metric to measure the degree of consistency in a certain time period.', 'If De(i, j, t1, t2) > De(i, j, t3, t4) and |t1 - t2| = |t3 - t4|, it can be stated that between sites i and j, the consistency of the states of entity e between time points t1 and t2 is lower than that between time points t3 and t4.', 'If De(i, j, t1, t2) > De(l, k, t1, t2), it can be stated that between time points t1 and t2, the consistency of the states of entity e between sites i and j is lower than that between sites l and k. In DR, the states of entities are composed of the positions and orientations of entities and some prediction related parameters (e.g.', 'Given two distinct sites i and j, which have replicated a shared entity e, at a given time point t, the positions of e at sites i and j are (xit, yit, zit) and (xjt, yjt, zjt), De(i, j, t) and D (i, j, t1, t2) could be calculated as: De(i, j, t) = )zz()yy()xx( jtit 2 jtit 2 jtit 2 (3) De(i, j, t1, t2) = dt)zz()yy()xx( 2t 1t jtit 2 jtit 2 jtit 2 (4) In this paper, formulas (3) and (4) are used as metrics to measure the consistency of shared entities between local and remote sites.', 'By employing physical clock synchronization, GS-DR can accurately calculate the states of shared entities after receiving state updates, and it can eliminate after inconsistency.', 'The first reason is the delay of sending state updates, as local site does not send a state update unless the difference between accurate state and the estimated one is larger than a predefined threshold.', 'From Figure 1, it can be seen that the after inconsistency is 0, and the before consistency is composed of two parts, D1 and D2.', 'In order to decrease before inconsistency, we propose GS-DR-LL, which combines GS-DR with local lag and can effectively decrease before inconsistency.', 'Furthermore, it is necessary to make corrections to a physical clock in a way that does not result in decreasing the value of the clock, for example by slowing down or halting the clock for a period of time.', 'Additionally it is assumed that the game scene is updated at a fixed frequency and T stands for the time interval between two consecutive updates, for example, if the scene update frequency is 50 Hz, T would be 20 ms. n stands for the lag value used by local lag, and t stands for current physical time.', 'Note that t2 - t1 is caused by network transmission delay and t1 - t0 is caused by the state filtering mechanism of DR.', 'In highly interactive games, which request high consistency and GS-DR-LL might be employed, the results of operations are quite difficult to be estimated and a small threshold must be used.', 'Thus, in practice, most before inconsistency is caused by network transmission delay and GS-DR-LL has the capability to eliminate such before inconsistency.', 'To GS-DR-LL, the selection of lag value n is very important, and both network transmission delay and the effects of local lag on interaction should be considered.', 'Thus if network transmission delay is less than the specific value of a game system, n can be set to the specific value.', 'Else n can be set in terms of the effects of local lag on the interaction of a system [14].', 'Traditional local lag requests that the lag value must be larger than typical network transmission delay, otherwise state repairs would flood the system.', 'In this case, the before inconsistency caused by network transmission delay still exists, but it can be decreased.', 'In order to simulate network transmission delay, a specific module was developed to delay all packets transmitted between the two computers in terms of a predefined delay value.', 'Six different combinations of lag and network transmission delay were used in the evaluation and they could be divided into two categories.', 'In the other category, the network transmission delay was fixed at 800 ms and three different lags (100 ms, 300 ms, and 500 ms) were used.', 'Under different settings and consistency maintenance approaches, the selected sub operation sequence was played back on one computer, and it drove the two spaceships, one was local and the other was remote, to move.', 'Since there are 12 settings and 2 consistency maintenance approaches, the total number of recorded track couples was 24.', 'Compared with GS-DR, GS-DR-LL can decrease more inconsistency, and it eliminates most inconsistency when the network transmission delay is 100 ms and the threshold is 4 pixels

execution, most of the existing grid infrastructures supports execution of isolated tasks, but they do not consider their task interdependencies as in processes (workflows) [12].', 'This deficiency restricts better scheduling algorithms, distributed execution coordination and automatic execution recovery.', 'There are few proposed middleware infrastructures that support process execution over the grid.', 'Among them, WebFlow [1] emphasizes an architecture to construct distributed processes; Opera-G [3] provides execution recovering and steering, GridFlow [5] focuses on improved scheduling algorithms that take advantage of activity dependencies, and SwinDew [13] supports totally distributed execution on peer-to-peer networks.', 'In order to address such constraints, this paper proposes a structured programming model for process description and a hierarchical process execution infrastructure.', 'The programming model and the support infrastructure, named X avantes, are under implementation in order to show the feasibility of the proposed model and to demonstrate its two major advantages: to promote widely distributed process execution and scheduling, but in a controlled, structured and localized way.', 'Next Section describes the programming model, and Section 3, the support infrastructure for the proposed grid computing model.', 'The last Section concludes this paper encompassing the advantages of the proposed hierarchical process execution support for the grid computing area and lists some future works.', 'PROGRAMMING MODEL The programming model designed for the

process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.', 'In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer

unsuccessful completion of its assigned tasks as a (nondecreasing) function of its congestion.', 'The resource cost function describes the cost suffered by an agent for selecting that resource, as a function of the number of agents who have selected it.', 'Nevertheless, if the failure probabilities are constant (do not depend on the congestion) then a potential function is guaranteed to exist.',

showed that every finite potential game is isomorphic to a congestion game; hence, the classes of finite potential games and congestion games coincide.', 'Much of the work on congestion games has been inspired by the fact that every such game has a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.', 'In particular, if in our model the resource failure probabilities were constant and known in advance, then a

Management System (SDIMS) that aggregates information about large-scale networked systems and that can serve as a basic building block for a broad range of large-scale distributed applications by providing detailed views of nearby information and summary views of global information.', 'To serve as a basic building block, a SDIMS should have four properties: scalability to many nodes and attributes, flexibility to accommodate a broad range of applications, administrative isolation for security and availability, and robustness to node and network failures.', 'We design, implement and evaluate a SDIMS that (1) leverages Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) to create scalable aggregation trees, (2) provides flexibility through a simple API that lets applications control propagation of reads and writes, (3) provides administrative isolation through simple extensions to current DHT algorithms, and (4) achieves robustness to node and network reconfigurations through lazy reaggregation, on-demand reaggregation, and tunable spatial replication.', 'INTRODUCTION The goal of this research is to design and build a Scalable Distributed Information Management System (SDIMS) that aggregates information about large-scale networked systems and that can serve as a basic building block for a broad range of large-scale distributed applications.', 'It provides a general interface for installing new aggregation functions and provides eventual consistency on its data.', 'This combination allows any communication pattern to yield eventual consistency and allows any node

(a) providing temporal replication through lazy reaggregation that guarantees eventual consistency and (b) ensuring that our flexible API allows demanding applications gain additional robustness by using tunable spatial replication of data aggregates or by performing fast on-demand reaggregation to augment the underlying lazy reaggregation or by doing both.', 'In Sections 3 and 4, we describe the design of our system for achieving the flexibility, scalability, and administrative isolation requirements of a SDIMS.', 'An internal non-leaf node, which we call virtual node, is simulated by one or more physical nodes at the leaves of the subtree for which the virtual node is the root.', 'Therefore our system provides only weak consistency guarantees - specifically eventual consistency as defined in [38].', 'For example, a read-dominated attribute like numCPUs rarely changes in value, while a writedominated attribute like numProcesses changes quite often.', 'SDIMS also allows non-uniform computation and propagation across the aggregation tree with different up and down parameters in different subtrees so that applications can adapt with the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of read and write operations.', 'Second, it refines the basic DHT abstraction to form an Autonomous DHT (ADHT) to achieve the administrative isolation properties that are crucial to scaling for large real-world systems.', '4.2 Administrative Isolation Aggregation trees should provide administrative isolation by ensuring that for each domain, the virtual node at the root of the smallest aggregation subtree containing all nodes of that domain is hosted by a node in that domain.', 'Administrative isolation is important for three reasons: (i) for security - so that updates and probes flowing in a domain are not accessible outside the domain, (ii) for availability - so that queries for values in a domain are not affected by failures of nodes in other domains, and (iii) for efficiency - so that domain-scoped queries can be simple and efficient.', 'To provide administrative isolation to aggregation trees, a DHT should satisfy two properties: 1.', 'As Figure 4 illustrates, whenever two nodes in a domain share the same prefix with respect to a key and no other node in the domain has a longer prefix, our algorithm introduces a virtual node at the boundary of the domain corresponding to that prefix plus the next digit of the key; such a virtual node is simulated by the existing node whose id is numerically closest to the virtual node\"s id.', 'The ADHT topology also enhances availability by allowing the common case of probes for data within a domain to depend only on a domain\"s nodes.', 'Aggregation trees that provide administrative isolation also enable the definition of simple and efficient domain-scoped aggregation functions to support queries like what is the average load on machines in domain X?', 'An aggregation function at an internal virtual node hosted on node N with child set C computes the aggregate as a set of tuples: for each domain D that N is part of, form a tuple (D,∑c∈C(count|(D,count) ∈ vc)).', 'Now a query for NumMachines with level set to MAX will return the aggregate values at each intermediate virtual node on the path to the root as a set of tuples (tree level, aggregated value) from which it is easy to extract the count of machines at each enclosing domain.', 'It would be less efficient because each intermediate virtual node will have to maintain a list of all values at the leaves in its subtree along with their names and it would be less convenient as applications that need an aggregate for a domain will have to pick values of nodes in that domain from the list returned by a probe and perform computation.', 'As Figure 6 illustrates, each physical node in the system acts as several virtual nodes in the AML: a node acts as leaf for all attribute keys, as a level-1 subtree root for keys whose hash matches the node\"s ID in b prefix bits (where b is the number of bits corrected in each step of the ADHT\"s routing scheme), as a level-i subtree root for attribute keys whose hash matches the node\"s ID in the initial i ∗ b bits, and as the system\"s global root for attribute keys whose hash matches the node\"s ID in more prefix bits than any other node (in case of a tie, the first non-matching bit is ignored and the comparison is continued [46]).', 'To support hierarchical aggregation, each virtual node at the root of a level-i subtree maintains several MIBs that store (1) child MIBs containing raw aggregate values gathered from children, (2) a reduction MIB containing locally aggregated values across this raw information, and (3) an ancestor MIB containing aggregate values scattered down from ancestors.', 'For a given virtual node ni at level i, each child MIB contains the subset of a child\"s reduction MIB that contains tuples that match ni\"s node ID in i bits and whose up aggregation function attribute is at least i.', 'A virtual node ni at level i also maintains an ancestor MIB to store the tuples containing attribute key and a list of aggregate values at different levels scattered down from ancestors.', 'Along with these MIBs, a virtual node maintains two other tables: an aggregation function table and an outstanding probes table.', 'Update When a level i virtual node receives an update for an attribute from a child below: it first recomputes the level-i aggregate value for the specified key, stores that value in its reduction MIB and then, subject to the function\"s up and domain parameters, passes the updated value to the appropriate parent based on the attribute key.', 'Also, the level-i (i ≥ 1) virtual node sends the updated level-i aggregate to all its children if the function\"s down parameter exceeds zero.', 'Upon receipt of a level-i aggregate from a parent, a level k virtual node stores the value in its ancestor MIB and, if k ≥ i−down, forwards this aggregate to its children.', 'A level-l virtual node for an attribute can issue the lease for levell aggregate to a parent or a child only if up is greater than l or it has leases from all its children.', 'A virtual node at level l can issue the lease for level-k aggregate for k > l to a child only if down≥ k −l or if it has the lease for that aggregate from its parent.', 'Now a probe for level-k aggregate can be answered by level-l virtual node if it has a valid lease, irrespective of the up and down values.', 'Our two main principles for robustness are to guarantee (i) read availability - probes complete in finite time, and (ii) eventual consistency - updates by a live node will be visible to probes by connected nodes in finite time.', '385 Reconfig

Assignment in Distributed Multi-Player Proxy-based Games Sudhir Aggarwal Justin Christofoli Department of Computer Science Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL {sudhir, christof}@cs.fsu.edu Sarit

within this architecture that can lead to better game playing experience in Massively Multi-player Online games.', 'Using this architecture, we propose an authority assignment mechanism that divides the authority for deciding the outcome of different actions/events that occur within the game between client and servers on a per action/event basis.', 'We show that such division of authority leads to a smoother game playing experience by implementing this mechanism in a massively multi-player online game called RPGQuest.', 'In addition, current MMOGs delegate all authority to the game server to make decisions about the results pertaining to the actions that game clients take and also to decide upon the result of other game related events.', 'Such centralized authority has been implemented with the claim that this improves the security and consistency required in a gaming environment.', 'For example, [4] shows that in a modern RPG called Everquest 2, the breakpoint of the game when adding artificial latency was 1250ms.', 'Second, we propose that assignment of authority in terms of who makes the decision on client actions such as object pickups and hits, and collisions between players, be distributed between the clients and the servers in order to distribute the computing load away from the central server.', 'In order to move towards more complex real-time networked games, we believe that definitions of authority must be refined.', 'In this paper we define what it means to have authority within the context of events and objects in a virtual game space.', 'We then show the benefits of delegating authority for different actions and game events between the clients and server.', 'into three different categories, a) events for which the game client has absolute authority, b) events for which the game server has absolute authority, and c) events for which the authority changes dynamically from client to the server and vice-versa.', 'We propose that authority for all decisions that pertain to a single player or object in the game that neither affects the other players or objects, nor are affected by the actions of other players be delegated to that player\"s game client.', 'In summary, we argue that while current authority models that only delegate responsibility to the server to make authoritative decisions on events is more secure than allowing the clients to make the decisions, these types of models add undesirable delays to events that could very well be decided by the clients without any inconsistency being introduced into the game.', 'We propose that a mixed authority assignment mechanism such as the one outlined above be implemented in high interaction MMOGs.', 'A communication proxy in the proposed architecture maintains information only about portions of the game space that are relevant to clients connected to it and is able to process the movement information of objects and players within these portions.', 'These functionalities of a communication proxy leads to a decrease in latency of event update and subsequently, better game playing experience.', 'Second, we propose a mixed authority assignment mechanism as described above that improves game playing experience.', 'Third, we implement the proposed mixed authority assignment mechanism within a MMOG called RPGQuest [8] to validate its viability within MMOGs.', 'In Section 2, we describe the proxy-based game architecture in more detail and illustrate its advantages.', 'In Section 3, we provide a generic description of the mixed authority assignment mechanism and discuss how it improves game playing experience.', 'In Section 4, we show the feasibility of implementing the proposed mixed authority assignment mechanism within existing MMOGs by describing a proof-of-concept implementation within an existing MMOG called RPGQuest.', 'We propose a communication proxy based architecture where a player connects to a (geographically) nearby proxy instead of connecting to a central server in the case of a centralserver architecture or to one of the servers in case of dis2 The 5th Workshop on Network & System Support for Games 2006 - NETGAMES 2006 tributed server architecture.', 'In this case the authority to change the state of the player resides with the server entirely and the client simply follows what the server instructs it to do.', 'Most of the current first person shooter (FPS) games and role playing games (RPG) fall under this category.', 'In this scenario, the authority to change the state of the player is given to the owning peer and all other peers simply follow the owner.', 'For example, Battle Zone Flag (BzFlag) [12] is a multiplayer client-server game where the client has all authority for making decisions.', 'Another problem with client authoritative approach is that of cheating by clients as there is no cross checking of the validation of the state changes authorized by the owner client.', 'We propose to use a hybrid approach to assign the authority dynamically between the client and the server.', 'That is, we assign the authority to the client to make the game responsive, and use the server\"s authority only when the client\"s individual authoritative decisions can make the game state inconsistent.', 'By moving the authority of time critical updates to the client, we avoid the added delay caused by requiring the server to validate these updates.', 'For example, in the flag pickup game, the clients will be given the authority to pickup flags only when other players are not within a range that they could imminently pickup a flag.', 'Only when two or more players are close by so that more than one player may claim to have picked up a flag, the authority for movement and flag pickup would go to the central server so that the game state does not become inconsistent.', 'We believe that in a large game-space where a player is often in a very wide open and sparsely populated area such as those often seen in the game Second Life [13], this hybrid architecture would be very beneficial because of the long periods that the client would have authority to send movement updates for itself.', 'We believe that our notion of authority can be used to develop a globally consistent state model of the evolution of a game.', 'However, if local authority is delegated to the client, in this case, the client\"s state is superimposed on the server\"s state to determine the correct global state.', 'In this situation, the client authority must revert to the server and the sever would then make decisions.', 'We believe that in complex MMOGs, when allowing more rapid movement, it will still be the case that local authority is possible for significant spans of game time.', 'While this may be true, we aim to create a new architecture where decisions do not always have to be made at the game server and the fastest route to a client is actually through a communication proxy located close to the client.', 'This proxy and distributed authority architecture can be used to its full potential only when the proxies can be placed at strategic places within the main ISPs and evenly distributed geographically.', 'However, when such move is published by the client, the proxy, being aware of the game space that the plane is in, can quickly check that the client has misused the authority and then can block such move.', 'This allows us to distribute authority to make decisions about the clients.', 'IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE We have experimented with the authority assignment mechanism described in the last section by implementing the mechanisms in a game called RPGQuest.', 'The basic functionality of this game is representative of current online first person shooter and role playing games.', 'In order to get around this problem, we developed a second version of the game, which gives all authority to the client.', 'The client was delegated the authority to validate its own movement and the authority to pick up objects without validation from the server.', 'This game model of complete authority given to the client is beneficial with respect to movement.', 'Although game playing experience with respect to responsiveness is improved when the authority for movement is given to the client, there are still aspects of games that do not benefit from this approach.', 'It is better to place authority on the client for quickly changing actions such as movement.', 'We believe that as the interactivity of games increases, our architecture of mixed authority that does not rely on server validation will be necessary.', 'To test the benefits and show the feasibility of our architecture of mixed authority, we developed a third version of the RPGQuest game that distributed authority for different actions between the client and server.', 'The client was given full authority to send positional updates to other clients and verify its own position without the need to verify its updates with the server.', 'This version of the RPGQuest game where authority is distributed between the client and server is an improvement from the server authoritative version.', 'However, the benefits of mixed authority will not truly be seen until an implementation of our communication proxy is integrated into the game.', 'The paper provides an implementation example of BZFlag which is a peer-to-peer game which is modified to transfer all authority to a central server.', 'In essence, this paper advocates an authority architecture which is server based even for peerto-peer games, but does not consider division of authority between a client and a server to minimize latency which could affect game playing experience even with the type of latency found in server based games (where all authority is with the server).', 'Our work differs from the above discussed previous works by proposing a) a distributed proxy-based architecture to decrease bandwidth requirements at the clients and the servers without requiring the proxies to keep state information about the whole game space, b) a dynamic authority assignment technique to reduce latency (by performing consistency checks locally at the client whenever possible) by splitting the authority between the clients and servers on a per object basis, and c) proposing that cheat detection can be built into the proxies if they are provided more information about the specific game instead of using them purely as communication proxies (although this idea has not been implemented yet and is part of our future work).', 'Second, we proposed a mixed authority assignment mechanism that divides authority for making decisions on actions and events within the game between the clients and server and argued how such an authority assignment leads to better game playing experience without sacrificing the consistency of the game.', 'Third, to validate the viability of the mixed authority assignment mechanism, we implemented it within a MMOG called RPGQuest and described our implementation experience.', 'In future work, we propose to implement the communications proxy architecture described in this paper and integrate the mixed authority mechanism within this architecture.', 'We also plan to implement a version of the RPGQuest game with dynamic assignment of authority to allow players the authority to pickup objects when no other players are near.'], ['In this study, we identify the network\"s lack of accountability as a fundamental obstacle to correcting this problem: Employing an economic model, we argue that optimal routes and innovation are impossible unless new monitoring capability is introduced and incorporated with the contracting system.', 'Furthermore, we derive the minimum requirements a monitoring system must meet to support first-best routing and innovation characteristics.', 'More importantly, commoditization in the short term is surely related to the lack of innovation in the long term.', 'This is exemplified by MacKie-Mason and Varian, who propose a smart market to control access to network resources [10].', 'Unlike the first two strategies, we are not aware of any previous studies that have connected accountability with the pathologies of commoditization or lack of innovation.', 'It is clear that these three strategies are closely linked to each other (for example, [2], [5], and [9] each argue that giving end-users routing control within the current contracting system is problematic).', 'There is currently little theoretical foundation to compare the relative merits of each proposal, and a particular lack of evidence linking accountability with innovation and service differentiation.', 'We will use our model for two main purposes: First, we will use our model to argue that the lack of accountability in today\"s network is a fundamental obstacle to overcoming the pathologies of commoditization and lack of innovation.', 'In other words, unless new monitoring capabilities are introduced, and integrated with the system of contracts, the network cannot achieve optimal routing and innovation characteristics.', 'The network\"s lack of accountability is highly relevant to a discussion of innovation because it constrains the system of contracts.', 'This is because contracts depend upon external institutions to function - the judge in the language of incomplete contract theory, or simply the legal system.', 'Ultimately, if a judge cannot verify that some condition holds, she cannot enforce a contract based on that condition.', 'Especially when a judge\"s ruling is easily predicted, the parties will typically comply with the contract terms on their own volition.', 'An institution to support contracts is typically complex, but we abstract it as follows: We imagine that a contract is an algorithm that outputs a payment transfer among a set of ISPs (the parties) at every time.', 'Hence, we imagine that a contract only accepts proofs as inputs.', 'Such a monitor includes metering or sensing devices on the physical network, but it is a more general concept.', 'The contractible monitor includes whatever distributed algorithmic mechanism is used to motivate ISPs to share this private information.', 'We may adopt this as our null hypothesis: Null hypothesis: Market forces are sufficient to maintain service diversity and innovation on a network, at least to the same extent as they do in traditional markets.', 'We will define an index of commoditization and show that it increases without bound as data paths grow long.', 'Network Behavior Monitor Contract Proof Payments 184 To summarize, we argue that the Internet\"s lack of accountability must be addressed before the pathologies of commoditization and lack of innovation can be resolved.', 'Applying this equilibrium concept, we derive the monitors needed to maintain innovation and optimize routes.', 'We describe a way to construct a rest of path monitor out of monitors for individual ISP quality and for the data path.', 'This requires a mechanism to motivate ISPs to share their monitor outputs with each other.', 'The rest of path monitor then includes the component monitors and the distributed algorithmic mechanism that ensures that information is shared as required.', 'This example shows that other types of monitors may be useful as building blocks, but must be combined to form rest of path monitors in order to achieve ideal innovation characteristics.', 'We show that new monitors must be implemented and integrated with the contracting system before the pathologies of commoditization and lack of innovation can be overcome.', 'We demonstrate how poor monitoring causes commoditization and a lack of innovation.', '2.1 Game Dynamics Ultimately, we are most interested in policies that promote innovation on the network.', 'In this study, we will use innovation in a fairly general sense.', 'At first, it may seem unclear how a large-scale distributed process such as innovation can be influenced by mechanical details like networks monitors.', 'The rate of innovation depends on the profits that potential innovators expect in the future.', 'Any model of network innovation must therefore relate at least three distinct processes: innovation, competition, and routing.', 'The innovation stage occurs first, at time 2−=t .', 'Our dynamics reflect the fact that ISPs make innovation decisions infrequently.', 'Hence, our model places innovation at the earliest stage, attempting to capture a single investment decision.', 'Because of this ordering, our model does not allow firms to route strategically to affect future innovation or contracting decisions.', 'The innovation game includes all three stages.', 'They cannot carry out threats they made in the innovation stage if it lowers their expected payoff.', 'If the routing game always selects the lowest-cost routes, for example, innovation will not be supported.', 'If the cheater has a contract which includes a customer lock-in period, 0t also includes the time until customers are allowed to switch to a new ISP.', 'We begin by defining a monitor, our model of the way that players receive external information about network behavior, A monitor is any distributed algorithmic mechanism that runs on the network graph, and outputs, to specific nodes, informational statements about current or past network behavior.', 'The accountability properties of the Internet can be represented by the following monitors: E2E (End to End): A monitor that informs S/D about what the total path quality is at any time (this is the quality they experience).', 'ROP (Rest of Path): A monitor that informs each node along the data path what the quality is for the rest of the path to the destination.', 'PRc (Packets Received): A monitor that tells nodes how much data they accept from each other, so that they can charge by volume.', 'Hence, for the sake of realism, it cannot be used to monitor what the data path is.', 'The monitor then includes the component monitors as well as whatever mechanisms are in place to motivate nodes to share information honestly as needed.', 'For the remainder of this section, we will assume that contracts are also linear - there is a constant payment flow so long as a node accepts data, and all conditions of the contract are met.', 'Restricting attention to linear contracts allows us to represent some node i\"s contract by its price, pi.', 'When a competition game exclusively uses bilateral contracts, we will call it a bilateral contract competition game.', 'Recall that this is a requirement in order for nodes to have any incentive to innovate.', 'To measure this tendency, we define an index of commoditization as follows: For a node on the data path, i, define its quality premium, minppd ji −= , where pj is the flow payment to the next hop in equilibrium, and pmin is the price of the lowest cost next hop.', 'Since lowest-price routing does not support innovation, we may speculate that innovation degrades with the length of the data path.', 'Hence, the reward for innovation is bounded by the same amount.', 'Claim 2 can alternately be viewed as a lower bound on how much it costs to elicit innovation in a network.', 'A verifiable monitor is a distributed algorithmic mechanism that runs on the network graph, and outputs, to specific nodes, proofs about current or past network behavior.', 'To do this, we will require our third and final category of monitor: A contractible monitor is simply a verifiable monitor that generates proofs that can serve as input to a contract.', 'Thus, contractible is jointly a property of the monitor and the institutions that must verify its proofs.', 'When a monitor (together with institutional infrastructure) meets these criteria, we will label it with a subscript c, for contractible.', 'Let each node on the path enter into a contract with its parent, which fixes an arbitrary payment schedule so long as the rest of path quality is as prescribed.', 'When the parent node, which has ROPc, submits a proof that the rest of path quality is less than expected, the contract awards her an instantaneous transfer, P, from the downstream node.', 'In this order, each node selects a contract to offer to its parents, consisting of a rest of path quality, and a linear price.', 'This property is favorable from an innovation perspective, since firms that invest in high quality will tend to fall on the optimal path, gaining positive payoff.', 'Extra conditions may be given under which innovation decisions approach perfect efficiency for large innovations.', 'The incentive structure of the VCG mechanism is what motivates nodes to report their costs accurately.', 'A nice feature of this game is that individual innovation decisions are efficient, meaning that a node will invest in an innovation whenever the investment cost is less than the increased welfare of the optimal data path.', 'Assume a set of monitors, and a nowhere-commoditized bilateral contract competition game that always maintains the optimal quality in fixed-route coalition-proof protect-the-innocent equilibrium, with only one node allowed to cheat at a time.', 'The source\"s contract must therefore distinguish when the path quality is normal from when it is lowered by cheating.', 'By definition, any monitor that gives the source proof that the path quality is wrong is an ROPc monitor.', 'Any monitor that gives the first hop proof that the quality is correct is a ROPc\" monitor.', 'The first hop\"s contract with the second must then distinguish when cheating occurs after the first hop.', 'The two possibilities for monitor correspond to which node has the burden of proof.', 'This is represented by the following two monitors: SHOPc i : (source-based hop quality) A monitor that gives the source proof of what the quality of node i is.', 'SPATHc: (source-based path) A monitor that gives the source proof of what the data path is at any time, at least as far as it matches the equilibrium path.', 'What we have done, all in all, is constructed a rest of path monitor using SPATHc and SHOPc i as building blocks.', 'Our new monitor includes both the component monitors and whatever distributed algorithmic mechanism exists to make sure nodes share their proofs correctly.', 'Hence, the entire discovery process acts as a rest of path monitor, albeit a rather costly monitor in this case.', 'Yet, without path information, SHOPc i is not sufficient for our first-best innovation result.', 'With monitors E2E, ROP, SHOPc i and PRc, and a nowhere-commoditized bilateral contract competition game, the optimal quality cannot be maintained for all assignments of quality and marginal cost, in fixed-route coalition-proof protect-theinnocent equilibrium.', 'We have argued that the poor accountability of the Internet is a fundamental obstacle to alleviating the pathologies of commoditization and lack of innovation.', 'We included an example in which individual hop quality monitors and a path monitor can also meet our standard for sustaining competition.', 'While a significant literature addresses innovation in the presence of network effects, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first model of innovation in a network industry that successfully incorporates the actual topological structure as input.', 'Can a contracting system support optimal multicast trees?', 'Perhaps its most important benefit is that each contract is local in nature, so both parties share a common, familiar legal jurisdiction.', 'The clearest alternative is to form a contract between the source and every node on the path.', 'A quality monitor can never anticipate every dimension of quality that future applications will care about, nor can it anticipate a new and valuable protocol that an ISP introduces.', 'We may define a monitor space as a subspace of the quality space that a monitor can measure, QM ⊂ , and a corresponding monitoring function that simply projects the full range of qualities onto the monitor space, MQm →: .', 'For subgame n,

rate means the percentage of shots that the sensor fusion was able to estimate the trajectory of.', 'The caliber accuracy rate is relative to the shots localized and not all the shots because caliber estimation requires the trajectory.', 'The trajectory error is broken down to azimuth in degrees and the actual distance of the shooter from the trajectory.', 'As such, it includes the error caused by both the trajectory and that of the range estimation.', 'Note that the traditional bearing and range measures are not good ones for a distributed system such as ours because of the lack of a single

ability to successfully estimate the trajectory of shots.', 'Since caliber estimation and weapon classification relies on the trajectory, non-localized shots are not classified either.', 'The reason for missed shots is the trajectory ambiguity problem that occurs when the projectile passes on one side of all the sensors.', 'Instead of estimating which one is more likely or displaying both possibilities, we decided not to provide a trajectory at all.', 'Localization accuracy is broken down to trajectory accuracy and range estimation precision.', 'The angle of the estimated trajectory was better than 1 degree except for the 300 m range.', 'Since the range should not affect trajectory estimation as long as the projectile passes over the network, we suspect that the slightly worse angle precision for 300 m is due to the hurried shots we witnessed the soldiers took near the end of the day.', 'This is also indicated by another datapoint: the estimated trajectory distance from the actual targets has an average error of 1.3 m for 300 m shots, 0.75 m for 200 m shots and 0.6 m for all but 300 m shots.', 'As the distance between the targets and the sensor network was fixed, this number should not show a 2× improvement just because the shooter is closer.', 'Since the angle of the trajectory itself does not characterize the overall error-there can be a translation alsoTable 1 also gives the distance of the shooter from the estimated trajectory.', 'To put this into perspective, a trajectory estimate for a 100 m shot will very likely go through or very near the window the shooter is located at.', 'As the ground truth was obtained by knowing the precise location of the shooter and the target, any inaccuracy in the actual trajectory directly adds to the perceived error of the system.', 'We call the estimation of the shooter\"s position on the calculated trajectory range estimation due to the lack of a better term.', 'The range estimates are better than 5% accurate from 50 m and 10% for 100 m. However, this goes to 20% or worse for longer distances.', 'These echoes reached the sensors before the real muzzle blast for long range shots only, since the projectile travels 2-3× faster than the speed of sound, so the time between the shockwave (and its possible echo from nearby objects) and the muzzle blast increases with increasing ranges.', 'The percentages are relative to the number of shots localized and not all shots, as the classification algorithm needs to know the trajectory and the range.', 'The caliber and weapon estimation accuracy rates are based on the 189 shots that were successfully localized.', 'Note that there was a single shot that was falsely classified by the caliber estimator.', 'The 73% overall weapon classification accuracy does not seem impressive.', 'Note that the AK47 and M240 have the same caliber (7.62 mm), just as the M16, M4 and M249 do (5.56 mm).', 'Since this is now not a distributed system, the results are given relative to the position of the given sensor, that is, a bearing and range estimate is provided.', 'There are several disadvantages of the single sensor case compared to the networked system: there is no redundancy to compensate for other errors and to perform outlier rejection, the localization rate is markedly lower, and a single sensor alone is not able to estimate the caliber or classify the weapon.', 'The bearing and range values are average errors.', 'In light of these factors, the overall average bearing error of 0.9 degrees and range error of 5 m with a microphone spacing of less than 10 cm are excellent.', 'We believe that professional manufacturing and better microphones could easily achieve better performance than the best sensor in our experiment (>60% localization rate and 3 m range error).', 'Interestingly, the largest error in range was a huge 90 m clearly due to some erroneous detection, yet the largest bearing error was less than 12 degrees which is still a good indication for the soldier where to look.', 'Note that the firing range was prepared to simulate an urban area to some extent: there were a few single- and two-storey wooden structures built both in and around the sensor deployment area and the firing lines.', '7.2 Error sources In this section, we analyze the most significant sources of error that affect the performance of the networked shooter localization and weapon classification system.', 'The z-axis is the resulting trajectory azimuth error.', 'Node location errors in this range have a small effect on accuracy.', 'This is primarily caused by geometry: for a successful localization, the bullet needs to pass over the sensor network, that is, at least one sensor should be on the side of the trajectory other than the rest of the nodes.', 'If all the sensors and the trajectory are not coplanar, localization may be successful even if the projectile passes on one side of the network.', 'Silencers reduce the muzzle blast energy and hence, the effective range the system can detect it at.', 'However, silencers do not effect the shockwave and the system would still detect the trajectory and caliber accurately.', 'The range and weapon type could not be estimated without muzzle blast detections.', 'For weapon classification to work accurately, the system would need to be calibrated with the typical ammunition used by the given adversary.', 'The focus is on the robust detection and length estimation of small caliber acoustic shockwaves and muzzle blasts.', 'It also demonstrates how the length of the shockwave, as determined by the edge detectors, can be used along with Whithams equations [20] to estimate the caliber of a projectile.', 'The fixed systems performance was one order of magnitude better in the angle calculations while their range performance where matched.', 'The range accuracy was around 5 percent for both of the systems.', 'Most noteworthy are the trajectory accuracy of one degree, the correct caliber estimation rate of well over 90% and the close to 100% weapon classification rate for 4 of the 6 weapons tested.', 'We believe that with the lessons learned in the test, a consecutive field experiment could have showed significantly improved results especially in range estimation beyond 100 m and weapon classification for the remaining two weapons that were mistaken for each other the majority of the times during the test.', 'While the overall localization rate of 42% per sensor for shots up to 130 m could be improved, the bearing accuracy of less than a degree and the average 5% range error are remarkable using the handmade prototypes of the low-cost nodes.'], ['San Jose, CA 95120 {phantom,wsl}@us.ibm.com ABSTRACT Web services can be aggregated to create composite workflows that provide streamlined functionality for human users or other systems.', 'Although industry standards and recent research have sought to define best practices and to improve end-to-end workflow composition, one area that has not fully been explored is the scheduling of a workflow\"s web service requests to actual service provisioning in a multi-tiered, multi-organisation environment.', 'Because these business processes are web service consumers, service requests must be mapped and scheduled across multiple web service providers, each with its own negotiated service level agreement.', 'In this paper we provide heuristics for scheduling service requests from multiple business process workflows to web service providers such that a business value metric across all workflows is maximised.', '[1, 9]), an important remaining problem is the assignment of web service requests to the underlying web service providers in a multi-tiered runtime scenario within constraints.', 'The problem of scheduling web service requests to providers is relevant to modern business domains that depend on multi-tiered service provisioning.', 'Workflows comprise multiple related business processes that are web service consumers; here we assume that the workflows represent requested service from customers or automated systems and that the workflow has already been composed with an existing choreography toolkit.', 'These workflows are then submitted to a portal (not shown) that acts as a scheduling agent between the web service consumers and the web service providers.', '), and for each service type, there are multiple instances of service providers that publish a web service interface.', 'An important challenge is that the workflows must meet some quality-of-service (QoS) metric, such as end-to-end completion time of all its business processes, and that meeting or failing this goal results in the assignment of a quantitative business value metric for the workflow; intuitively, it is desired that all workflows meet their respective QoS goals.', 'We further leverage the notion that QoS service agreements are generally agreed-upon between the web service providers and the scheduling agent such that the providers advertise some level of guaranteed QoS to the scheduler based upon runtime conditions such as turnaround time and maximum available concurrency.', 'The resulting problem is then to schedule and assign the business processes\" requests for service types to one of the service providers for that type.', 'In Section 3 we state the scenario as a combinatorial problem and utilise a genetic search algorithm [5] to find the best assignment of web service requests to providers.', 'In Section 4 we show through experimentation that this search heuristic finds better assignments than other algorithms (greedy, round-robin, and proportional).', 'RELATED WORK In the context of service assignment and scheduling,

guarantee a level of performance defined by the completion time for completing a web service invocation.', 'This guarantee is defined by several parameters: α is the expected completion time (for example, on the order of seconds) if the assigned workload of web service requests is less than or equal to β, the maximum concurrency, and if the workload is higher than β, the expected completion for a workload of size ω is α+ γ(ω − β) where γ is a fractional coefficient.', 'The key research problem, then, is to assign the business processes to the web service providers with the goal of optimising on the aggregate business value of all workflows.', '3.2 Genetic algorithm Given an exponential search space of business process assignments to web service providers, the problem is to find the optimal assignment that produces the overall highest aggregate business value across all workflows.', 'To explore the solution space, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) search heuristic that simulates Darwinian natural selection by having members of a population compete to survive in order to pass their genetic chromosomes onto the next generation; after successive generations, there is a tendency for the chromosomes to converge toward the best combination [5] [6].', '(Note that although we are optimising against the business value metric we defined earlier, genetic algorithms are able to converge towards the optimal value of any metric, as long as the evaluation function can consistently measure a chromosome\"s value with that metric.)', 'While useful, it does not capture the

in order to get better estimates of service agreement guarantees, although we expect that such guarantees between the providers and their consumers are not generally available to the public.',

gaining popularity and has become a show piece of \"utility computing\".', 'Since in the IT industry, various computing models are used interchangeably with grid computing, we first sort out the

target environment uses data carriers, termed zebroids, where a mobile device carries a data item on behalf of a server to a client thereby minimizing its availability latency.', 'In this study, we quantify the variation in availability latency with zebroids as a function of a rich set of parameters such as car density, storage per device, repository size, and replacement policies employed by zebroids.', 'Significant improvements in latency can be obtained with zebroids at the cost of a minimal overhead.', 'Two particularly surprising findings are: (1) a naive random replacement policy employed by the zebroids shows competitive performance, and (2) latency improvements obtained with a simplified instantiation of zebroids are found to be robust to changes in the popularity distribution of the data items.', 'In this case, availability latency is the time from when the user issues a request until when the AutoMata encounters another car containing the referenced data item.', 'The availability latency for an item is a function of the current location of the client, its destination and travel path, the mobility model of the AutoMata equipped vehicles, the number of replicas constructed for the different data items, and the placement of data item replicas across the vehicles.', 'A method to improve the availability latency is to employ data carriers which transport a replica of the requested data item from a server car containing it to a client that requested it.', 'Otherwise, the chosen relay team of z zebroids hand over the data item transitively to one another to arrive at the client, thereby reducing availability latency (see Section 3.1 for details).', 'Finally, storage constraints may require a zebroid to evict existing data items from its local storage to accommodate the client requested item.', 'In this study, we quantify the following main factors that affect availability latency in the presence of zebroids: (i) data item repository size, (ii) car density, (iii) storage capacity per car, (iv) client trip duration, (v) replacement scheme employed by the zebroids, and (vi) accuracy of the car route predictions.', 'A naive random replacement policy employed by the zebroids shows competitive performance in terms of availability latency.', 'With such a policy, substantial improvements in latency can be obtained with zebroids at a minimal replacement overhead.', 'In more practical scenarios, where the dispatcher has inaccurate information about the car routes, zebroids continue to provide latency improvements.', 'A surprising result is that changes in popularity of the data items do not impact the latency gains obtained with a simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids called one-instantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).', 'However, none of these studies employ zebroids as data carriers to reduce the latency of the client\"s requests.', 'A novel characteristic of our study is the impact on availability latency for a given database repository of items.', 'Section 2 provides an overview of the terminology along with the factors that impact availability latency in the presence of zebroids.', 'δi Average availability latency of data item i δagg Aggregate availability latency, δagg = T j=1 δj · fj AutoMata System Parameters G Number of cells in the map (2D-torus).', 'The availability latency for a data item i, denoted as δi, is defined as the earliest time at which a client AutoMata will find the first replica of the item accessible to it.', 'We are interested in the availability latency observed across all data items.', 'Hence, we augment the average availability latency for every data item i with its fi to obtain the following weighted availability latency (δagg) metric: δagg = T i=1 δi · fi Next, we present our solution approach describing how zebroids are selected.', 'Note that the latency along the quickest delivery path that employs a relay team of z zebroids is similar to that obtained with epidemic routing [19] under the assumptions of infinite storage and no interference.', 'A simple instantiation of z-relay zebroids occurs when z = 1 and the client\"s request triggers a transfer of a copy of the requested data item from a server to a zebroid in its vicinity.', 'Such a zebroid is termed one-instantaneous zebroid.', 'Hence, a zebroid scheduled on the basis of this inaccurate information may not rendezvous with its target client.', 'This may incur additional overhead due to redundant resource utilization to obtain the same latency improvements.', 'The time required to transfer a data item from a server to a zebroid depends on its size and the available link bandwidth.', 'When the local storage of a zebroid is completely occupied, it needs to replace one of its existing items to carry the client requested data item.', 'For this purpose, the zebroid must select an appropriate candidate for eviction.', 'We have considered local and global variants of the LRU/LFU policies which determine whether local or global knowledge of contents of the cars known at the dispatcher is used for the eviction decision at a zebroid (see [9] for more details).', 'ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY Here, we present the analytical evaluation methodology and some approximations as closed-form equations that capture the improvements in availability latency that can be obtained with both oneinstantaneous and z-relay zebroids.', 'Such a mobility model has been used widely in the literature [17, 16] chiefly because it is amenable to analysis and provides a baseline against which performance of other mobility models can be compared.', 'Moreover, this class of Markovian mobility models has been used to model the movements of vehicles [3, 21].', 'With the random walk mobility model on a 2D-torus, there is a guarantee that as long as there is at least one replica of the requested data item in the network, the client will eventually encounter this replica [2].', 'In this case, the expected availability latency for the data item is the expected meeting time of the random walk undertaken by the client with any of the random walks performed by the servers.', 'The meeting time, or equivalently the availability latency δi, for the client requesting data item i is the time till it encounters any of these ri replicas for the first time.', 'This is also an exponential distribution with the following expected value (note that this formulation is valid only for sparse cases when G >> ri): δi = cGlogG ri The aggregate availability latency without employing zebroids is then this expression averaged over all data items, weighted by their frequency of access: δagg(no − zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri = T i=1 fi · C ri (2) 77 4.1 One-instantaneous zebroids Recall that with one-instantaneous zebroids, for a given request, a new replica is created on a car in the vicinity of the server, provided this car meets the client earlier than any of the ri servers.', 'The availability latency is reduced since the client is more likely to meet a replica earlier.', 'The aggregated expected availability latency in the case of one-instantaneous zebroids is then given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 fi · c · G · log G ri + Nc i = T i=1 fi · C ri + Nc i (4) Note that in obtaining this expression, for ease of analysis, we have assumed that the new replicas start from random locations in the torus (not necessarily from the same cell as the original ri servers).', 'As we shall show below by comparison with simulations, this approximation provides an upper-bound on the improvements that can be obtained because it results in a lower expected latency at the client.', 'It should be noted that the procedure listed above will yield a similar latency to that employed by a dispatcher employing oneinstantaneous zebroids (see Section 3.1).', 'Since the dispatcher is aware of all future car movements it would only transfer the requested data item on a single zebroid, if it determines that the zebroid will meet the client earlier than any other server.', 'This selected zebroid is included in the Nc i new replicas.', '4.2 z-relay zebroids To calculate the expected availability latency with z-relay zebroids, we use a coloring problem analog similar to an approach used by Spyropoulos et al.', 'The aggregate availability latency (δagg) with z-relay zebroids is given by, δagg(zeb) = T i=1 [fi · C N + 1 · 1 N + 1 − ri · (N · log N ri − log (N + 1 − ri))] (5) 5.', 'A Markov mobility model representing a unbiased 2D random walk on the surface of the torus describes the movement of the cars across this torus.', '• Either one-instantaneous or z-relay zebroids may be employed per client request for latency improvement.', 'Hence the possible values of availability latency are between 0 and γ. δ is defined as the number of time slots after which a client AutoMata device will encounter a replica of the data item for the first time.', 'The square-root replication scheme is shown to have competitive latency performance over a large parameter space [8].', 'After a maximum period of γ, the latency encountered by this request is recorded.', 'Moreover, the 95% confidence intervals determined for the results are quite tight for the metrics of latency and replacement overhead.', 'Hence, we only present them for the metric that captures the

mobility pattern of the cars is random, hence, the locations from which the requests are issued by clients are also random and not known a priori at the dispatcher.', 'These findings are significant because a random replacement policy can be implemented in a simple decentralized manner.', 'The lru-global and lfu-global schemes provide a latency performance that is worse than random.', 'The higher number of replicas for the popular data items provide marginal additional benefits, while the lower number of replicas for the other data items hurts the latency performance of these global policies.', 'Initially, when the network is sparse the analytical approximation for improvements in latency with zebroids, obtained from Equations 2 and 4, closely matches the simulation results.', 'Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the analysis provides an upper bound on the latency improvements, as it treats the newly created replicas given by Nc i independently.', 'Finally, the analysis captures a oneshot scenario where given an initial data item replica distribution, the availability latency is computed.', 'Similar observations, like the one-instantaneous zebroid case, apply since the simulation and analysis curves again start diverging when the analysis assumptions are no longer valid.', 'However, the key observation here is that the latency improvement with z-relay zebroids is significantly better than the one-instantaneous zebroids case, especially for lower storage scenarios.', 'Moreover, it is also seen that the simulation validation curve for the improvements in δagg with z-relay zebroids approaches that of the one-instantaneous zebroid case for higher storage (higher N values).', '6.2.2 Simulation We conduct simulations to examine the entire storage spectrum

= 25.', 'With Figure 3.b, keeping α constant, initially increasing car density has higher latency benefits because increasing N introduces more zebroids in the system.', 'Hence, the replacement policy

display and seamless mobility across a broad range of different clients and screen sizes, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.', 'pTHINC also leverages existing PDA control buttons to improve system usability and maximize available screen resolution for application display.', 'Our results compared to local PDA web browsers and other thin-client approaches demonstrate that pTHINC

these devices to deliver pervasive web access, and mobile web users already often use these devices to access web-enabled information such as news, email, and localized travel guides and maps.', 'Users typically access web content by running a web browser and associated helper applications locally on the PDA.', 'Although native web browsers exist for PDAs, they deliver subpar performance and have a much smaller feature set and more limited functionality than their desktop computing counterparts [10].', 'Because the desktop application market is larger and more mature, most development effort generally ends up being spent on desktop applications, resulting in greater functionality and performance than their PDA counterparts.', 'Instead, developers are forced to significantly strip down these web browsers to provide a usable PDA web browser, thereby crippling PDA browser functionality.', 'Thin-client computing provides an alternative approach for enabling pervasive web access

unfeasible task.', 'On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.', 'The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA

one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.', 'A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.', 'By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.', 'We follow common practice and refer to Citrix MetaFrameXP

can occur between client and server in thin-client systems as well as client processing time, which may be significant in the case of PDAs.', 'To run the web browsing benchmark, we used Mozilla

['INTRODUCTION A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of a large number of in-situ battery-powered sensor nodes.', 'In many application scenarios, WSNs are employed to conduct surveillance tasks in adverse, or even worse, in hostile working environments.', 'Therefore, fault tolerance of a WSN is critical.', 'One way to achieve fault tolerance is that a WSN should contain a large number of redundant nodes in order to tolerate node failures.', 'Redundancy should be exploited as much as possible for the set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network area [6].', 'The honeycomb structure poses that the coverage efficiency is the best if each point represents a sensor node that is providing surveillance work.', 'This enlightens us that maximizing ι is a good approach to select a set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network area.', 'An algorithm called Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction (MIND) is proposed in which redundant sensor nodes are removed to obtain a large ι for each set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network area.', 'We show that maximizing ι of a WSN results in low redundancy of the network.', 'Second, we formulate a general sensor-grouping problem for WSNs and provide a general sensing model.', 'In Section 2, we introduce our point-distribution index ι.', 'We survey related work and formulate a sensor-grouping problem together with a general sensing model in Section 3.', 'If the sensor coverage model is the Boolean

separate from one another.', 'Under the constraint that the sensing area should be covered, the more each node separates from the others, the less the redundancy of the coverage is.', 'In our following discussions, we will show the effectiveness of employing ι in sensor-grouping problem.', 'A node sleeping-working schedule scheme is therefore highly desired to exploit the redundancy of working sensors and let as many nodes as possible sleep.', 'Ye et al developed PEAS in which sensor nodes wake up randomly over time, probe their neighboring nodes, and decide whether they should begin to take charge of surveillance work [18].', 'SSCP can provide different levels of redundancy to maintain different requirements of fault tolerance.', 'Each set of sensor nodes are able to maintain the required area surveillance work.', 'We call the issue sensor-grouping problem.', 'It is a greedy algorithm in which the priority of selecting a given sensor is determined by how many uncovered regions this sensor covers and the redundancy caused by this sensor.', 'The solution of sensor-grouping problem should only base on locally obtainable information of a sensor node.', 'In Subsection 3.1, we provide a general problem formulation of the sensor-grouping problem.', 'It is followed by discussion in Subsection 3.2 on a general sensing model, which serves as a given condition

computation consists of a set of processes that cooperate to achieve a common goal.', 'The timestamp of an event produced by a process is the current value of the vector clock of the corresponding

the relevant events that causally precede a given relevant event e, only a subset are its immediate predecessors: those are the events f such that there is no relevant event on any causal path from f

components and the required performance, the objective of our power management strategy is adjust the duty cycle D(i) dynamically so as to maximize the total utility U(D) over a period of time, while ensuring energy neutral operation for the sensor node.', 'Before discussing the performance scaling methods for harvesting aware duty cycle adaptation, let us first consider the optimal power management strategy that is possible for a given energy generation profile.', 'Suppose the time axis is partitioned into discrete slots of duration ΔT, and the duty cycle adaptation calculation is carried out over a window of Nw such time slots.', 'We define the following energy profile variables, with the index i ranging over {1,…, Nw}: Ps(i) is the power output from the harvested source in time slot i, averaged over the slot duration, Pc is the power consumption of the load in active mode, and D(i) is the duty cycle used in slot i, whose value is to be determined.', 'However, the window Nw is judiciously chosen such that over that duration, we expect the environmental energy availability to complete a periodic cycle.', 'HARVESTING-AWARE POWER MANAGEMENT We now present a practical algorithm for power management that may be used for adapting the performance based on harvested energy information.', 'This algorithm attempts to achieve energy neutral operation without using knowledge of the future energy availability and maximizes the achievable performance within that constraint.', 'The harvesting-aware power management strategy consists of three parts.', 'The third part consists of a method to dynamically adapt the duty cycle in response to the observed energy generation profile in real time.', 'This step is required since the observed energy generation may deviate significantly from the predicted energy availability and energy neutral operation must be ensured with the actual energy received rather than the predicted values.', 'While the storage data size is limited to a vector length of Nw values in order to minimize the memory overheads of the power management algorithm, the window size is effectively infinite as each value in the history window depends on all the observed data up to that instant.', 'The window size is chosen to be 24 hours and each time slot is taken to be 30 minutes as the variation in generated power by the solar panel using this setting is less than 10% between each adjacent slots.', 'Since our objective is to maximize the total system utility, it is preferable to set the duty cycle to Dmin for time slots where the utility per unit energy is the least.', 'The algorithm starts by assuming D(i) =Dmin for i = {1…NW} because of the minimum duty cycle requirement, and computes the remaining system energy R by: 1 1 (

beyond Dmin for some slots.', 'Since our objective is to maximize the total system utility, the most efficient way to allocate the excess energy is to assign duty cycle Dmax to the slots with the highest W(i).', 'So, the coefficients W(i) are arranged in decreasing order and duty cycle Dmax is assigned to the slots beginning with the largest coefficients until the excess energy available, R (computed by (14) in every iteration), is insufficient to assign Dmax to another slot.', 'The remaining energy, RLast, is used to increase the duty cycle to some value between Dmin and Dmax in the

hyperplane that were found in previous optimizations over examples {x1, .', 'If we re-train on every example that is not well-classified, our hyperplane will be guaranteed to be optimal at every step.', 'Successive iterations of this loop bring the hyperplane closer to an optimal value.', 'EXPERIMENTS In Section 2, we argued that the strong performance on content-based spam detection with SVMs with a high value of C show that the maximum margin criteria is overkill, incurring unnecessary computational cost.', 'In Section 3, we proposed ROSVM to address this issue, as both of these methods trade away guarantees on the maximum margin hyperplane in return for reduced computational cost.', 'Our main tests on content-based spam detection are performed on large benchmark sets of email data.', 'We then apply these methods on the smaller data sets of blog comment spam and blogs, with similar performance.', 'These results are important for making state of the art performance on large-scale content-based spam detection practical with online SVMs.', 'This suggests that any additional iterations are spent attempting to find improvements to a hyperplane that is already very close to optimal.', 'As noted before, when M = 1, the hyperplane is globally optimal at every step.', 'Reducing M allows a slightly inconsistent hyperplane to persist until it encounters an example

and Engineering The Chinese University of Hong Kong Shatin, NT, Hong Kong {hxyang,king,lyu}@cse.cuhk.edu.hk ABSTRACT While the PageRank algorithm has proven to be very effective for ranking Web pages, the rank scores of Web pages can be manipulated.', 'To handle the manipulation problem and to cast a new insight on the Web structure, we propose a ranking algorithm called DiffusionRank.', 'DiffusionRank is motivated by the heat diffusion phenomena, which can be connected to Web ranking because the activities flow on the Web can be imagined as heat flow, the link from a page to another can be treated as the pipe of an air-conditioner, and heat flow can embody the structure of the underlying Web graph.', 'INTRODUCTION While the PageRank algorithm [13] has proven to be very effective for ranking Web pages, inaccurate PageRank results are induced because of web page manipulations by people for commercial interests.', 'From the viewpoint of the Web site operators who want to increase the ranking value of a particular page for search engines, Keyword Stuffing and Link Stuffing are being used widely [7, 12].', 'To successfully apply machine learning methods, we need to dig out some useful textual features for Web pages, to mark part of the Web pages as either spam or non-spam, then to apply supervised learning techniques to mark other pages.', 'In the next section, we give a brief literature review on various related ranking techniques.', 'As in previous work [7, 13], we focus on ranking methods solely determined by hyperlink structure of the Web graph.', 'All the mentioned ranking algorithms are established on a graph.', 'Although there are many variations of PageRank, e.g., a family of link-based ranking algorithms in [2], TrustRank is especially chosen for comparisons for three reasonss: (1) it is designed for combatting spamming; (2) its fixed parameters make a comparison easy; and (3) it has a strong theoretical relations with PageRank and DiffusionRank.', '2.3 Manifold Ranking In [17], the idea of ranking on the data manifolds was proposed.', 'While the manifold ranking algorithm achieves an impressive result on ranking images, the biased vector g and the parameter k in the general personalized PageRank in [17] are unknown in the Web graph setting; therefore we do not include it in the comparisons.', 'The readers can find that our model is a generalization of PageRank in order to resist Web manipulation, that we inherit the first part of TrustRank, that we borrow the concept of ranking on the manifold to introduce our model, and that heat diffusion is a main scheme in this paper.', 'HEAT DIFFUSION MODEL Heat diffusion provides us with another perspective about how we can view the Web and also a way to calculate ranking values.', 'This can be seen from the equal voting ability of one page: the sum of each column is equal to one.', 'This equal voting ability of all pages gives the chance for a Web site operator to increase a manipulated page by creating a large number of new pages pointing to this page since all the newly created pages can obtain an equal voting right.', 'This input-independent property makes it impossible to set a special initial input (larger values for trusted pages and less values even negative values for spam pages) to avoid web spam.', 'We expect a ranking algorithm that has an effect of anti-manipulation as TrustRank while respecting the true web structure as PageRank.', 'This ranking algorithm is also motivated by the viewpoint for the Web structure.', 'To model the real world problem, we further build HDM on a random graph as a practical case.', '(1), the Web graph is actually modelled as a random graph, there is an edge from node vi to node vj with a probability of (1 − α)gj (see the item (1 − α)g1T ), and that the Web graph is predicted by a random graph [15, 16].', 'The second one is that the Web structure is a random graph in essence if we consider the content similarity between two pages, though this is not done in this paper.', 'The definition of a random graph is given below.', 'A random graph RG = (V, P = (pij)) is defined as a graph with a vertex set V in which the edges are chosen independently, and for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ |V | the probability of (vi, vj) being an edge is exactly pij.', 'Note that every static graph can be considered as a special random graph in the sense that pij can only be 0 or 1.', 'On a random graph RG = (V, P), where P = (pij) is the probability of the edge (vi, vj) exists.', 'In the next section, we mainly focus on DiffusionRank in the random graph setting.', 'Output: DiffusionRank score vector h. 1: s = 1 2: for i = 1 TO MI do 3: s = αI · U · s + (1 − αI ) · 1 n · 1 4: end for 5: Sort s in a

Algorithm For the ranking task, we adopt the heat kernel on a random graph.', 'In the algorithm, the underlying random graph is set as P = αB · A + (1 − αB) · 1 n · 1n×n, which is induced by the Web graph.', 'While it is a natural application for DiffusionRank because of the easy interpretation by the amount heat from one group to another group, it is difficult to apply other ranking techniques to such an application because they lack such a physical meaning.', 'Based on the fact that the connection from a trusted page to a bad page should be weak-less uncross paths, longer distance and narrower pipe, we can say DiffusionRank can resist web spam if we can select trusted pages.', 'For such an application of DiffusionRank, the computation complexity for Discrete Diffusion Kernel is the same as that for PageRank in cases of both a static graph and a random graph.', 'When γ = 0, the ranking value is most robust to manipulation since no heat is diffused and the system is unchangeable, but the Web structure is completely ignored since eγR f(0) = e0R f(0) = If(0) = f(0); when γ = ∞, DiffusionRank becomes PageRank, it can be manipulated easily.', 'We also test the order difference between the ranking order A before the page is manipulated and the ranking order PA after the page is manipulated.', 'Improving web search ranking by incorporating user behavior information.',

frequently used by other users.', 'Search engines, such as Google, Yahoo!, MSN, Ask Jeeves, all have implemented query suggestion functionality as a valuable addition to their core search method.',

expressed in different manners [12, 14, 26].', 'However, all of the existing studies dealt with monolingual query suggestion and to our knowledge, there is no published study on cross-lingual query suggestion (CLQS).', '1 CLQS can be approached as a query translation problem, i.e., to suggest the queries that are translations of the original query.', 'A natural thinking of solving this mismatch is to map the queries in the source language and the queries in the target language, by using the query log of a search engine.', 'As a result, a query written in a source language likely has an equivalent in a query log in the target language.', 'Besides being benchmarked as an independent module, the resulting CLQS system is tested as a new means of query translation in CLIR task on TREC

introduces the related work; Section 3 describes in detail the discriminative model for estimating cross-lingual query similarity; Section 4 presents a new CLIR approach using cross-lingual query

target language query log has been exploited to help query translation in CLIR.', 'ESTIMATING CROSS-LINGUAL QUERY SIMILARITY A search engine has a query log containing user queries in different

Bruce Croft Department of Computer Science University of Massachusetts, Amherst {yzhou, croft}@cs.umass.edu ABSTRACT Current prediction techniques, which are generally designed for content-based queries and are typically evaluated on relatively homogenous test collections of small sizes, face serious challenges in web search environments where collections are significantly more heterogeneous and different types of retrieval tasks exist.', 'We focus on performance prediction for two types of queries in web search environments: content-based and Named-Page finding.', 'However, web search environments pose significant challenges to current prediction models that are mainly designed for traditional TREC settings.', 'For example, the reported prediction accuracy of the ranking robustness technique and the clarity technique on the GOV2 collection (a large web collection) is significantly worse compared to the other TREC collections [1].', 'Furthermore, web search goes beyond the scope of the ad-hoc retrieval task based on topical relevance.', 'Third, in real-world web search environments, user queries are usually a mixture of different types and prior knowledge about the type of each query is generally unavailable.', 'The mixed-query situation raises new problems for query performance prediction.', 'Despite these problems, the ability to handle this situation is a crucial step towards turning query performance prediction from an interesting research topic into a practical tool for web retrieval.', 'Our work focuses on query performance prediction for the content-based (ad-hoc) retrieval task and the name-page finding task in the context of web retrieval.', 'Our first technique, called weighted information gain (WIG), makes use of both single term and term proximity features to estimate the quality of top retrieved documents for prediction.', 'Moreover, we demonstrate that good prediction accuracy can be achieved for the mixed-query situation by using WIG with the help of a query type classifier.', 'The difficulties of applying these models in web search environments have already been mentioned.', 'PREDICTION MODELS 3.1 Weighted Information Gain (WIG) This section introduces a weighted information gain approach that incorporates both single term and proximity features for predicting performance for both content-based and Named-Page (NP) finding

retrieved to a posterior state that the actual search results are observed.', 'This method is derived from the ranking robustness technique [1] that is mainly designed for content-based queries.', 'Based on these results, we recommend treating all queries as the NP type when only one query type exists and accurate query classification is not feasible, considering the risk that a large loss of accuracy will occur if NP queries are incorrectly labeled as content-based queries.', 'According to these standards, a NP query with the reciprocal rank above 0.2 or a content-based query with the average precision above 0.315 will be considered as good.', 'In the first strategy (denoted by robust), we use the robustness score for query performance prediction with the help of a perfect query classifier that always correctly map a query into one of the two categories (that is, NP or CB).', 'CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To our knowledge, our paper is the first to thoroughly explore prediction of query performance in web search environments.', 'We demonstrated that our models resulted in higher prediction accuracy than previously published techniques not specially devised for web search scenarios.'], ['The second is aimed at assessing refined models that exploit characteristic features of the new test set, such as the organizational structure of the university, and the hierarchical structure of the topics in the test set.', 'This task is usually addressed by uncovering associations between people and topics [10]; commonly, a co-occurrence of the name of a person with topics in the same context is assumed to be evidence of expertise.', 'Typically, this setting features several additional types of structure: topical structure (e.g., topic hierarchies as employed by the organization), organizational structure (faculty, department, ...), as well as multiple types of documents (research and course descriptions, publications, and academic homepages).', 'In addition to, how can the topical and organizational structure be used for retrieval purposes?', 'While on the W3C setting the expert finding task appears to be more difficult than profiling, for the UvT data the opposite is the case.', 'Finally, we demonstrate that the organizational structure can be exploited in the form of a context model, improving MAP scores for certain models by up to 70%.', 'We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.', 'In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates\" names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.', 'In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].', '[21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before.', '4.1 From topics to candidates Using Candidate Models: Model 1 Model 1 [4] defines the probability of a query given a candidate (p(q|ca)) using standard language modeling techniques, based on a multinomial unigram language model.', 'For each candidate ca, a candidate language model θca is inferred such that the probability of a term given θca is nonzero for all terms, i.e., p(t|θca) > 0.', 'The candidate language model is inferred as follows: (1) an empirical model p(t|ca) is computed; (2) it is smoothed with background probabilities.', '(5) The probability of a query given a document is estimated by inferring a document language model θd for each document d in a similar manner as the candidate model was inferred: p(t|θd) = (1 − λ)p(t|d) + λp(t), (6) where p(t|d) is the probability of the term in the document.', 'Instead of attempting to model the query generation process via candidate or document models, we represent the query as a topic language model and directly estimate the probability of the candidate p(ca|q).', 'As with the previous models, a language model is inferred, but this time for the query.', 'When we compare the results across languages, we find that the coverage of English topics (%q) is higher than of the Dutch ones for expert finding.', 'Three approaches are strictly content-based, and establish similarity by examining co-occurrence patterns of topics within the collection, while the last approach exploits the hierarchical structure of topical areas that may be present within an organization (see [7] for further examples of integrating word relationships into language models).', 'We find a positive impact of the context models only for expert finding.'], ['In contextual advertising usually there is a commercial intermediary, called an ad-network, in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between publisher and

between a given ad and a page.', 'In general we would like the match to be stronger when both the ad and the page are classified into the same node Figure 2: Two generalization paths and weaker when the distance between the nodes in the taxonomy gets larger.', 'To determine the rate of decline we consider the impact on the specificity of the match when we substitute a class with one of its ancestors.', 'The density is obtained by classifying a large set of ads in the taxonomy using the document classifier described above.', 'SEARCHING THE AD SPACE In the previous section we discussed the choice of scoring function to estimate the match between an ad and a page.', 'To be able to search the ads on a combination of keywords and classes we have mapped the classification match to term match and adapted the scoring function to be suitable for fast evaluation over inverted indexes.', 'EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION 7.1 Data and Methodology We quantify the effect of the semantic-syntactic matching using a set of 105 pages.', 'This indicates that when the keyword match is really strong (i.e.', 'when the ad is almost contained within the page) the precision 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0

'Note that purely syntactic match (α = 0) is by far the weakest method.', 'All existing commercial contextual match solutions known to us evolved from search advertising solutions whereby a search query is matched to the bid phrase of the ads.', 'A natural extension of search advertising is to extract phrases from the page and match them to the bid phrase of the ads.', 'In this paper we proposed a novel way of matching advertisements to web pages that rely on a topical (semantic) match as a major component of the relevance score.', 'The semantic match relies on the classification of pages and ads into a 6000 nodes commercial advertising taxonomy to determine their topical distance.', 'The semantic match is complemented with a syntactic match and the final score is a convex combination of the two sub-scores with the relative weight of each determined by a parameter α.', 'The effectiveness of the syntactic match depends on the quality of the pages used.'], [' A New Approach for Evaluating Query Expansion: Query-Document Term Mismatch Tonya Custis Thomson Corporation 610 Opperman Drive St. Paul, MN tonya.custis@thomson.com Khalid Al-Kofahi Thomson Corporation 610 Opperman Drive St. Paul, MN khalid.al-kofahi@thomson.com ABSTRACT The effectiveness of information retrieval (IR) systems is influenced by the degree of term overlap between user queries and relevant documents.', 'IR systems implementing query expansion are typically evaluated by executing each query twice, with and without query expansion, and then comparing the two result sets.', 'While this measures an overall change in performance, it does not directly measure the effectiveness of IR systems in overcoming the inherent issue of term mismatch between the query and relevant documents, nor does it provide any insight into how such systems would behave in the presence of query-document term mismatch.', 'In this paper, we propose a new approach for evaluating query expansion techniques.', 'Therefore, it is important to develop information retrieval systems that are robust with respect to language variations or term mismatch between queries and relevant documents.', 'During our work on developing such systems, we concluded that current evaluation methods are not sufficient for this purpose.', 'This query-document term mismatch arises from two sources: (1) the synonymy found in natural language, both at the term and the phrasal level, and (2) the degree to which the user is an expert at searching and/or has expert knowledge in the domain of the collection being searched.', 'An effective evaluation method should measure the performance of IR systems under varying degrees of query-document term mismatch, not just in terms of overall performance on a collection relative to another system.', 'In order to measure that a particular IR system is able to overcome query-document term mismatch by retrieving documents that are relevant to a user\"s query, but that do not necessarily contain the query terms themselves, we systematically introduce term mismatch into the test collection by removing query terms from known relevant documents.', 'Because we are purposely inducing term mismatch between the queries and known relevant documents in our test collections, the proposed evaluation framework is able to measure the effectiveness of QE in a way that testing on the whole collection is not.', 'Explicit query expansion occurs at run-time, based on the initial search results, as is the case with relevance feedback and pseudo relevance feedback [34, 37].', 'Implicit query expansion can be based on statistical properties of the document collection, or it may rely on external knowledge sources such as a thesaurus or an ontology [32, 17, 26, 50, 51, 2].', 'Often, the expansion terms added to a query in the query expansion phase end up hurting the overall retrieval performance because they introduce semantic noise, causing the meaning of the query to drift.', 'The evaluation of IR systems has received much attention in the research community, both in terms of developing test collections for the evaluation of different systems [11, 12, 13, 43] and in terms of the utility of evaluation metrics such as recall, precision, mean average precision, precision at rank, Bpref, etc.', 'There is general interest in the research community to improve the robustness of IR systems by improving retrieval performance on difficult queries, as is evidenced by the Robust track in the TREC competitions and new evaluation measures such as GMAP.', 'By purposely inducing mismatch between the terms in queries and relevant documents, our evaluation framework allows us a controlled manner in which to degrade the quality of the queries with respect to their relevant documents, and then to measure the both the degree of (induced) difficulty of the query and the degree to which QE improves the retrieval performance of the degraded query.', 'In cross-language IR, [28] explores different query expansion techniques while purposely degrading their translation resources, in what amounts to expanding a query with only a controlled percentage of its translation terms.', 'Introducing query-document term mismatch into the test collection in this manner allows us to manipulate the degree of term mismatch between relevant documents and queries in a controlled manner.', 'Systematically removing query terms from known relevant documents introduces a controlled amount of query-document term mismatch by which we can evaluate the degree to which particular QE techniques are able to retrieve conceptually relevant documents, despite a lack of actual term overlap.', 'The evaluation framework presented in this paper consists of three elements: a test collection, C; a strategy for selecting which query terms to remove from the relevant documents in that collection, S; and a metric by which to compare performance of the IR systems, m. The test collection, C, consists of a document collection, queries, and relevance judgments.', 'The strategy, S, determines the order and manner in which query terms are removed from the relevant documents in C. This evaluation framework is not metric-specific; any metric (MAP, P@10, recall, etc.)', 'Although test collections are difficult to come by, it should be noted that this evaluation framework can be used on any available test collection.', 'Based on the purpose of the evaluation and the retrieval algorithm being used, it might make more sense to choose a removal order for S based on query term IDF or perhaps based on a measure of query term probability in the document collection.', 'The incremental additive removal of query terms from relevant documents allows the evaluation to show the degree to which IR system performance degrades as more and more query terms are missing, thereby increasing the degree of query-document term mismatch.', 'EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP 4.1 IR Systems We used the proposed evaluation framework to evaluate four IR systems on two test collections.', 'Of the four systems used in the evaluation, two implement query expansion techniques: Okapi (with pseudo-feedback for QE), and a proprietary concept search engine (we\"ll call it TCS, for Thomson Concept Search).', '4.4 Metrics In this implementation of the evaluation framework, we chose three metrics by which to compare IR system performance: mean average precision (MAP), precision at 10 documents (P10), and recall at 1000 documents.', 'Because TCS employs implicit query expansion using an external domain specific knowledge base, it is less sensitive to term removal (i.e., mismatch) than the Okapi FB, which relies on terms from the top-ranked documents retrieved by an initial keywordonly search.', 'Perhaps the most interesting result from our evaluation is that although the keyword-only baselines performed consistently and as expected on both collections with respect to query term removal from relevant documents, the performances of the engines implementing QE techniques differed dramatically between collections.', 'DISCUSSION The intuition behind this evaluation framework is to measure the degree to which various QE techniques overcome term mismatch between queries and relevant documents.', 'A systematic evaluation of IR systems as outlined in this paper is useful not only with respect to measuring the general success or failure of particular QE techniques in the presence of query-document term mismatch, but it also provides insight into how a particular IR system will perform when used by expert versus non-expert users on a particular collection.', 'The less a user knows about the domain of the document collection on which they are searching, the more prevalent query-document term mismatch is likely to be.', 'Since query terms are masked only the in relevant documents, this evaluation framework is actually biased against retrieving relevant documents.', 'Although not attempted in our experiments, another application of this evaluation framework would be to remove query terms individually, rather than incrementally, to analyze which terms (or possibly which types of terms) are being helped most by a QE technique on a particular test collection.', 'This evaluation framework allows us to see how IR systems perform in the presence of query-document term mismatch.', 'By systematically introducing this mismatch, we can see that even if an IR system is not the best performer on the entire collection, its performance may nonetheless be more robust to query-document term mismatch than other systems.', 'The results presented in this paper are not by any means meant to be exhaustive or entirely representative of the ways in which this evaluation could be applied.', 'CONCLUSION The proposed evaluation framework allows us to measure the degree to which different IR systems overcome (or don\"t overcome) term mismatch between queries and relevant documents.', 'Further, we can model the behavior of expert versus non-expert users by manipulating the amount of query-document term mismatch introduced into the collection.',

retrievals.', 'We also describe the first large-scale experiment to evaluate zero-judgment performance prediction for a massive number of retrieval systems over a variety of collections in several languages.', 'Score consistency can be measured by the spatial version of autocorrelation known as the Moran coefficient or IM [5, 10].', 'The cluster hypothesis states: closely-related documents tend to be relevant to the same request [12].', 'As we shall see, a retrieval function\"s spatial autocorrelation measures the degree to which closely-related documents receive similar scores.', 'Because of this, we interpret autocorrelation as measuring the degree to which a retrieval function satisfies the clustering hypothesis.', 'If this connection is reasonable, in Section 6, we present evidence that failure to satisfy the cluster hypothesis correlates strongly with poor performance.', 'A theoretical treatment of the similarities and motivations behind several state-of-the-art performance

retrieval system produces a ranking of documents in the collection encoded as a set of scores associated with documents.', 'If we want to quantify the spatial dependencies of a function, we would employ a measure referred to as the spatial autocorrelation [5, 10].', 'High spatial autocorrelation suggests that knowing the value of a function at location a will tell us a great deal about the value at a neighboring location b.', 'There is a high spatial autocorrelation for a function representing the temperature of a location since knowing the temperature at a location a will tell us a lot about the temperature at a neighboring location b.', 'Low spatial autocorrelation suggests that knowing the value of a function at location a tells us little about the value at a neighboring location b.', 'There is low spatial autocorrelation in a function measuring the outcome of a coin toss at a and b.', 'We would like to compare autocorrelation values for different retrievals.', 'Therefore, we use the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality to establish a bound, ˜IM ≤ n eTWe s yTWTWy yTy And we define the normalized spatial autocorrelation as IM = yT Wy p yTy × yTWTWy Notice that if we let ˜y = Wy, then we can write this formula as, IM = yT ˜y y 2 ˜y 2 (3) which can be interpreted as the correlation between the original retrieval scores and a set of retrieval scores diffused in the space.', '5.1 Detailed Experiments In these experiments, we will predict the performance of language modeling scores using our autocorrelation predictor, ρ(y, ˜y); we do not consider ρ(y, yµ) or ρ(˜y, yµ) because, in these detailed experiments, we focus on ranking the retrievals from a single system.', '5.1.1 Topics and Collections These performance prediction experiments use language model retrievals performed for queries associated with collections in the TREC corpora.', 'However, these improvements are slight compared to the performance of autocorrelation on these collections.', 'Though not always the strongest, autocorrelation achieves correlations competitive with baseline predictors.', 'When examining the performance of linear combinations of predictors, we note that in every case, autocorrelation factors as a necessary component of a strong predictor.', 'However, our autocorrelation measure does not achieve high correlations perhaps because relevance for entity retrieval does not propagate according to the cooccurrence links we use.', 'On the other hand, autocorrelation seems robust to the changes between different corpora.', 'In the cases where ρ(y, yµ) performs well, incorporating autocorrelation rarely results in a significant improvement in performance.', 'We believe that autocorrelation is, like multiple-retrieval algorithms, approximating a good ranking; in this case by diffusing scores.', 'Nevertheless, in situations where this information is lacking, autocorrelation provides substantial information.', 'The success of autocorrelation as a predictor may also have roots in the clustering hypothesis.', 'Recall that we regard autocorrelation as the degree to which a retrieval satisfies the clustering hypothesis.', 'Query-based information retrieval systems often score documents independently.', 'We should make it clear that we have selected tasks where topical autocorrelation is appropriate.', 'For example, ranked lists which incorporate document novelty should not exhibit spatial autocorrelation; if anything autocorrelation should be negative for this task.', 'RELATED WORK In this section we draw more general comparisons to other work in performance prediction and spatial data analysis.', 'Neville and Jensen define relational autocorrelation for relational learning problems and demonstrate that many classification tasks manifest autocorrelation [13].', 'Temporal autocorrelation of initial retrievals has also been used to predict performance [9].', 'However, temporal autocorrelation is performed by projecting the retrieval function into the temporal embedding space.', 'We present correlations between the classic Clarity measure (DV KL), the ranking robustness measure (P), and autocorrelation (ρ(y, ˜y)) each

and autocorrelation cause feature selection bias in relational learning.'], ['In this paper, we focus on the rank aggregation problem, also called data fusion problem, where rankings of documents, searched into the same collection and provided by multiple methods, are combined in order to produce a new ranking.', 'In this context, we propose a rank aggregation method within a multiple criteria framework using aggregation mechanisms based on decision rules identifying positive and negative reasons for judging whether a document should get a better rank than another.', 'Several studies argued that rank aggregation has the potential of combining effectively all the various sources of evidence considered in various input methods.', '[3] also found that rank aggregation methods improve the performances w.r.t.', 'The rank aggregation problem was addressed in various fields such as i) in social choice theory which studies voting algorithms which specify winners of elections or winners of competitions in tournaments [29], ii) in statistics when studying correlation between rankings, iii) in distributed databases when results from different databases must be combined [12], and iv) in collaborative filtering [23].', 'Most current rank aggregation methods consider each input ranking as a permutation over the same set of items.', 'We first review current rank aggregation methods in Section 2.', 'RELATED WORK As pointed out by Riker [25], we can distinguish two families of rank aggregation methods: positional methods which assign scores to items to be ranked according to the ranks they receive and majoritarian methods which are based on pairwise comparisons of items to be ranked.', '2.1 Preliminaries We first introduce some basic notations to present the rank aggregation methods in a uniform way.', 'The rank aggregation or data fusion problem consists of finding a ranking function or mechanism Ψ (also called a social welfare function in the social choice theory terminology) defined by: Ψ : n D → D PR = ( 1, 2, . . . , n) → σ = Ψ(PR) where σ is called a consensus ranking.', 'When used for the rank aggregation problem, ranks are assumed to be scores or performances to be combined using aggregation operators such as the weighted sum or some variation of it [3, 31, 17, 28].', 'In the IR context, rank aggregation methods need to decide more or less explicitly which assumptions to retain w.r.t.', 'Trying to overcome the limits of current rank aggregation methods, we found that outranking approaches, which were initially used for multiple criteria aggregation problems [26], can also be used for the rank aggregation purpose, where each ranking plays the role of a criterion.', 'It also satisfies important properties of rank aggregation methods, called neutrality, Pareto-optimality, Condorcet property and Extended Condorcet property, in the social choice literature [29].', 'EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 5.1 Test Setting To facilitate empirical investigation of the proposed methodology, we developed a prototype metasearch engine that implements a version of our outranking approach for rank aggregation.', 'Our approach effectiveness is

yumaol}@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT Traditionally, stemming has been applied to Information Retrieval tasks by transforming words in documents to the their root form before indexing, and applying a similar transformation to query terms.', 'In this paper, we propose a context sensitive stemming method that addresses these two issues.', 'Second, our approach performs a context sensitive document matching for those expanded variants.', 'Using word pluralization handling as an example of our stemming approach, our experiments on a major Web search engine show that stemming only 29% of the query traffic, we can improve relevance as measured by average Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG5) by 6.1% on these queries and 1.8% over all query traffic.', 'One traditional solution is to use stemming [16, 18], the process of transforming inflected or derived words to their root form so that a search term will match and retrieve documents containing all forms of the term.', 'Stemming during indexing allows very little flexibility during query processing, while stemming by query expansion allows handling each query differently, and hence is preferred.', 'Although traditional stemming increases recall by matching word variants [13], it can reduce precision by retrieving too many documents that have been incorrectly matched.', 'When examining the results of applying stemming to a large number of queries, one usually finds that nearly equal numbers of queries are helped and hurt by the technique [6].', 'As we will show in the experiments, this is true even if we simplify stemming to pluralization handling, which is the process of converting a word from its plural to singular form, or vice versa.', 'Thus, one needs to be very cautious when using stemming in Web search engines.', 'One problem of traditional stemming is its blind transformation of all query terms, that is, it always performs the same transformation for the same query word without considering the context of the word.', 'A second problem of traditional stemming is its blind matching of all occurrences in documents.', 'To alleviate these two problems, we propose a context sensitive stemming approach for Web search.', 'We use pluralization handling as a running example for our stemming approach.', 'As we have to point out, the method we propose is not limited to pluralization handling, it is a general stemming technique, and can also be applied to general query expansion.', 'Experiments on general stemming yield additional significant improvements over pluralization handling for long queries, although details will not be reported in this paper.', 'We describe the details of the context sensitive stemming approach in Section 3.', 'However, the Porter stemming makes many mistakes because its simple rules cannot fully describe English morphology.', 'We use a similar corpus based approach for stemming by computing the similarity between two words based on their distributional context features which can be more than just adjacent words [15], and then only keep the morphologically similar words as candidates.', 'Using stemming in information retrieval is also a well known technique [8, 10].', 'However, the effectiveness of stemming for English query systems was previously reported to be rather limited.', 'Later, Harman [9] compares three general stemming techniques in text retrieval experiments including pluralization handing (called S stemmer in the paper).', 'They also proposed selective stemming based on query length and term importance, but no positive results were reported.', 'These mixed results, mostly failures, led early IR researchers to deem stemming irrelevant in general for English [4], although recent research has shown stemming has greater benefits for retrieval in other languages [2].', 'Blind stemming, or a simple query length based selective stemming as used in [9] is not enough.', 'A more general problem related to stemming is query reformulation [3, 12] and query expansion which expands words not only with word variants [7, 22, 24, 25].', 'On the other hand, stemming is much more conservative since most of the time, stemming preserves the original search intent.', 'With quality stemming, good documents which were not selected before stemming will be pushed up and those low quality documents will be degraded.', 'Our approach is unique in that it performs predictive stemming on a per query basis without relevance feedback from the Web, using the context of the variants in documents to preserve precision.', 'It\"s simple, yet very efficient and effective, making real time stemming feasible for Web search.', 'Our results will affirm researchers that stemming is indeed very important to large scale information retrieval.', 'CONTEXT SENSITIVE STEMMING 3.1 Overview Our system has four components as illustrated in Figure 1: candidate generation, query segmentation and head word detection, context sensitive

Porter stemmer [18] morphological rules to the similarity list.', 'After applying these rules, for the word develop, the stemming candidates are developing, developed, develops, development, developement, developer, developmental.', 'Thus, it is extremely important to identify which queries should not be stemmed for the purpose of maximizing relevance improvement and minimizing stemming cost.', 'If we accept matches of every occurrence of comparison, it will hurt retrieval precision and this is one of the main reasons why most stemming approaches do not work well for information retrieval.', 'EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION 4.1 Evaluation metrics We will measure both relevance improvement and the stemming cost required to achieve the relevance.', '4.1.2 Stemming cost Another metric is to measure the additional cost incurred by stemming.', 'Given the same level of relevance improvement, we prefer a stemming method that has less additional cost.', 'We also remove all one word queries since stemming one word queries without context has a high risk of changing query intent, especially for short words.', '4.3 Naive stemming for Web search Before explaining the experiments and results in detail, we\"d like to describe the traditional way of using stemming for Web search, referred as the naive model.', 'The query book store will be transformed into (book OR books)(store OR stores) when limiting stemming to pluralization handling only, where OR is an operator that denotes the equivalence of the left and right arguments.', 'Then we improve the naive stemming model by

This paper reports on theoretical investigations about the assumptions underlying the inverse document frequency (idf ).', 'We show that an intuitive idf -based probability function for the probability of a term being informative assumes disjoint document events.', 'INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND The inverse document frequency (idf ) is one of the most successful parameters for a relevance-based ranking of retrieved objects.', 'With N being the total number of documents, and n(t) being the number of documents in which term t occurs, the idf is defined as follows: idf(t) := − log n(t) N , 0 <= idf(t) < ∞ Ranking based on the sum of the idf -values of the query terms that occur in the retrieved documents works well, this has been shown in numerous applications.', 'Also, it is well known that the combination of a document-specific term weight and idf works better than idf alone.', 'This approach is known as tf-idf , where tf(t, d) (0 <= tf(t, d) <= 1) is the so-called term frequency of term t in document d. The idf reflects the discriminating power (informativeness) of a term, whereas the tf reflects the occurrence of a term.', 'The idf alone works better than the tf alone does.', 'In a tf-idf approach, the removal of stopwords is conceptually obsolete, if stopwords are just words with a low idf .', 'From a probabilistic point of view, tf is a value with a frequency-based probabilistic interpretation whereas idf has an informative rather than a probabilistic interpretation.', 'The missing probabilistic interpretation of idf is a problem in probabilistic retrieval models where we combine uncertain knowledge of different dimensions (e.g.', ': informativeness of terms, structure of documents, quality of documents, age of documents, etc.)', 'An intuitive solution is a normalisation of idf such that we obtain values in the interval [0; 1].', 'For example, consider a normalisation based on the maximal idf -value.', 'Pfreq (t is informative) := idf(t) maxidf maxidf := max({idf(t)|t ∈ T}), maxidf <= − log(1/N) minidf := min({idf(t)|t ∈ T}), minidf >= 0 minidf maxidf ≤ Pfreq (t is informative) ≤ 1.0 This frequency-based probability function covers the interval [0; 1] if the minimal idf is equal to zero, which is the case if we have at least one term that occurs in all documents.', 'Can we interpret Pfreq , the normalised idf , as the probability that the term is informative?', 'When investigating the probabilistic interpretation of the 227 normalised idf , we made several observations related to disjointness and independence of document events.', 'We show in section 3.1 that the frequency-based noise probability n(t) N used in the classic idf -definition can be explained by three assumptions: binary term occurrence, constant document containment and disjointness of document containment events.', 'In section 3.2 we show that by assuming independence of documents, we obtain 1 − e−1 ≈ 1 − 0.37 as the upper bound of the noise probability of a term.', 'In section 5, we emphasise that the theoretical framework of this paper is applicable for both idf and tf .', 'BACKGROUND The relationship between frequencies, probabilities and information theory (entropy) has been the focus of many researchers.', 'We will generalise the discussion by pointing out that document frequency and term frequency are dual parameters in the collection space and the document space,

documents (definition 2).', 'and the noise probability for independent documents (definition 3).', '3.1 Binary occurrence, constant containment and disjointness of documents We show in this section, that the frequency-based noise probability n(t) N in the idf definition can be explained as a total probability with binary term occurrence, constant document containment and disjointness of document

function as constant if for all events the probability is equal.', 'Next, we define the frequency-based noise probability and the total noise probability for disjoint documents.', 'We introduce the event notation t is noisy and t occurs for making the difference between the noise probability P(t is noisy|c) in a collection and the occurrence probability P(t occurs|d) in a document more explicit, thereby keeping in mind that the noise probability corresponds to the occurrence probability of a term in a collection.', 'The total term noise probability for disjoint documents: Pdis (t is noisy|c) := d P(t occurs|d) · P(d|c) Now, we can formulate a theorem that makes assumptions explicit that explain the classical idf .', 'IDF assumptions: If the occurrence probability P(t|d) of term t over documents d is binary, and the containment probability P(d|c) of documents d is constant, and document containments are disjoint events, then the noise probability for disjoint documents is equal to the frequency-based noise probability.', 'The assumptions are: ∀d : (P(t occurs|d) = 1 ∨ P(t occurs|d) = 0) ∧ P(d|c) = λ N ∧ d P(d|c) = 1.0 We obtain: Pdis (t is noisy|c) = d|t∈d 1 N = n(t) N = Pfreq (t is noisy|c) The above result is not a surprise but it is a mathematical formulation of assumptions that can be used to explain the classical idf .', 'From the assumptions, we can conclude that idf (frequencybased noise, respectively) is a relatively simple but strict estimate.', 'Still, idf works well.', 'From that point of view, idf means that P(t ∧ d|c) is constant for all d in which t occurs, and P(t ∧ d|c) is zero otherwise.', 'This is a further explanation why we can estimate the idf with a simple P(t|d), since the combined tf-idf contains the occurrence probability.', 'From a probability theory point of view, we can consider documents as disjoint events, in order to achieve a sound theoretical model for explaining the classical idf .', 'In the next section, we replace the

perform eager implicit feedback, e.g., query expansion based on previous queries and immediate result reranking based on clickthrough information.', 'Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over the popular Google search engine.', 'In order to optimize retrieval accuracy, we clearly need to model the user appropriately and personalize search according to each individual user.', 'The major goal of user modeling for information retrieval is to accurately model a user\"s information need, which is, unfortunately, a very difficult task.', 'However, since a query is often extremely short, the user model constructed based on a keyword query is inevitably impoverished .', 'It is thus very interesting to study how to infer a user\"s information need based on any implicit feedback information, which naturally exists through user interactions and thus does not require any extra user effort.', 'Indeed, several previous studies have shown that implicit user modeling can improve retrieval accuracy.', 'It is shown that the dwelling time on a page, amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong correlation with explicit relevance ratings, which suggests that implicit feedback may be helpful for inferring user information need.', 'In [25], the clickthrough data collected over a long time period is exploited through query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy.', 'In such cases, implicit feedback information collected over a long period of time is unlikely to be very useful, but the immediate search context and feedback information, such as which of the search results for the current information need are viewed, can be expected to be much more useful.', 'In this paper, we study how to construct

further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding

implicit feedback information [25].', '(2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous

studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22].', 'In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.', 'Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but

responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.', 'Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately

user modeling in interactive information retrieval.', 'L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current

At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).', 'Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information.', '3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.', 'The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.', 'In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the system\"s understanding of the user\"s information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the user\"s interaction history.', 'Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the user\"s reading level and occupation.', 'If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.', 'To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.', 'A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.', 'For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.', 'The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.', 'We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .', 'In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented.', '(3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.', '4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).', 'We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).', '4.4 Result reranking In general, we want to rerank all the unseen results as soon as the user model is updated.', 'In both cases, the current (updated) user model would be used to rerank the unseen results so that the user would see improved search results immediately.', 'Since implicit feedback is not completely reliable, we bring up only a small number (e.g.', '828 Google result (user query = java map) UCAIR result (user query =java map) previous query = travel Indonesia previous query = hashtable expanded user query = java map Indonesia expanded user query = java map class 1 Java map projections of the world ...

increasingly large, complex bodies of data, how may we improve access to collections without incurring extraordinary cost, and while also keeping systems receptive to changes in content over time?', 'What is increasingly clear, however, as digital libraries grow in scope and complexity, is the applicability of these techniques to problems at the front-end of systems such as information architecture and interface design.'], ['In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine.', 'More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.', 'As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.', 'There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.', 'Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].', 'We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.', 'Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.', 'This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.', 'Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.', 'For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.', 'Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.', 'Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.', 'Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].', 'We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.', 'However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].', 'This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.', 'To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.', 'The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.', 'However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.', 'Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.', 'For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.', 'However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.', 'Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.', 'Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.', 'In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.', 'That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.', 'We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines.', 'It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on.', 'In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.', 'In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.', 'The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.', 'Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.', 'This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.', 'This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).', 'However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.', 'The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.', 'In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.', 'Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].', 'We first briefly introduce the newly proposed vertical image search engine - EnjoyPhoto

framework for resource selection of distributed text information retrieval.', 'With the estimated relevance information, resource selection can be made by explicitly optimizing the goals of different applications.', 'Distributed information retrieval, also known as federated search [1,4,7,11,14,22] is different from ad-hoc information retrieval as it addresses the cases when documents cannot be acquired and stored in a single database.', 'A database recommendation system goes a step further than a browsing system like Invisible-web.net by recommending most relevant information sources to users\" queries.', 'It is composed of the resource description and the resource selection components.', 'It selects relevant information sources for users\" queries as the database recommendation system does.', 'The goal of a database recommendation system is to select a small set of resources that contain as many relevant documents as possible, which we call a high-recall goal.', 'On the other side, the effectiveness of distributed document retrieval is often measured by the Precision of the final merged document result list, which we call a high-precision goal.', 'However, most previous solutions simply use effective resource selection algorithm of database recommendation system for distributed document retrieval system or solve the inconsistency with heuristic methods [1,4,21].', 'This paper presents a unified utility maximization framework to integrate the resource selection problem of both database recommendation and distributed document retrieval together by treating them as different optimization goals.', 'A logistic transformation model is learned off line with a small amount of training queries to map the centralized document scores in the centralized sample database to the corresponding probabilities of relevance.', 'For the task of resource selection for a database recommendation system, the databases can be ranked by the expected number of relevant documents to meet the high-recall goal.', 'For resource selection for a distributed document retrieval system, databases containing a small number of documents with large probabilities of relevance are favored over databases containing many documents with small probabilities of relevance.', 'This selection criterion meets the high-precision goal of distributed document retrieval application.', 'Two key features make it a more solid model for distributed information retrieval: i) It formalizes the resource selection problems of different applications as various utility functions, and optimizes the utility functions to achieve the optimal results accordingly; and ii) It shows an effective and efficient way to estimate the probabilities of relevance of all documents across databases.', 'Sections 5 and 6 present our experimental results for resource selection and document retrieval.', 'Many resource selection algorithms such as gGlOSS/vGlOSS [8] and CORI [1] have been proposed in the last decade.', 'The relevant document distribution estimation (ReDDE [21]) resource selection algorithm is a recent algorithm that tries to estimate the distribution of relevant documents across the available databases and ranks the databases accordingly.', 'In order to achieve accurate document retrieval results, many previous methods simply use resource selection algorithms that are effective of database recommendation system.', 'But as pointed out above, a good resource selection algorithm optimized for high-recall may not work well for document retrieval, which targets the high-precision goal.', 'We also describe how the model can be optimized for the high-recall goal of a database recommendation system and the high-precision goal of a distributed document retrieval system.', '3.1 Estimating Probabilities of Relevance As pointed out above, the purpose of resource selection is highrecall and the purpose of document retrieval is high-precision.', 'For each training query, the CORI resource selection algorithm [1] is applied to select some number (e.g., 10) of databases and retrieve 50 document ids from each database.', '3.2 The Unified Utility Maximization Model In this section, we formally define the new unified utility maximization model, which optimizes the resource selection problems for two goals of high-recall (database recommendation) and high-precision (distributed document retrieval) in the same framework.', 'We generalize the database recommendation selection process, which implicitly recommends all documents in every selected database, as a special case of the selection decision for the document retrieval task.', 'In other words, we only need to calculate ),( * dU θ and Equation 7 is simplified as follows: ),(maxarg * *

the resource selection algorithm in federated search tasks such as database recommendation.', '3.4 Resource Selection for High-Precision High-Precision is the goal of resource selection algorithm in federated search tasks such as distributed document retrieval.', 'RESULTS: RESOURCE SELECTION OF DATABASE RECOMMENDATION All four testbeds described in Section 4 were used in the experiments to evaluate the resource selection effectiveness of the database recommendation system.', 'Resource selection algorithms of database recommendation systems are typically compared using the recall metric nR [1,17,18,21].', 'Let B denote a baseline ranking, which is often the RBR (relevance based ranking), and E as a ranking provided by a resource selection algorithm.', 'The experiments summarized in Figure 3 compared the effectiveness of the three resource selection algorithms, namely the CORI, ReDDE and UUM/HR.', 'It can be seen from Figure 3 that the ReDDE and UUM/HR algorithms are more effective (on the representative, relevant and nonrelevant testbeds) or as good as (on the Trec123-100Col testbed) the CORI resource selection algorithm.', 'The Trec123-100Col and representative testbeds were selected for document retrieval as they represent two extreme cases of resource selection effectiveness; in one case the CORI algorithm is as good as the other algorithms and in the other case it is quite Table 5.', 'On the representative testbed, CORI is much less effective than other algorithms for distributed document retrieval (Tables 5 and 6).', 'As the unified utility maximization model only utilizes retrieval scores of sampled documents with a centralized retrieval algorithm to calculate the probabilities of relevance, it makes database selection decisions without referring to the document scores from individual databases and can be easily generalized to this case of rank lists without document scores.', 'Most previous research use effective resource selection algorithm of database recommendation system for distributed document retrieval application.', 'We argue that the high-recall resource selection goal of database recommendation and high-precision goal of document retrieval are related but not identical.', 'In this work we propose a unified utility maximization model to integrate the resource selection of database recommendation and document retrieval tasks into a single unified framework.', 'One algorithm for resource selection (UUM/HR) and two algorithms for document retrieval (UUM/HP-FL and UUM/HP-VL) are derived from this framework.', 'Furthermore, the UUM/HP-FL and UUM/HP-VL resource selection algorithms are extended with a variant of SSL results merging algorithm to address the distributed document retrieval task when selected databases do not return document scores.'], ['49 Zhichun Road, Haidian, Beijing, China, 100080 {hangli,yucao}@microsoft.com Qinghua Zheng Computer Science Department Xi\"an Jiaotong University No 28,

benefits: • Relevance: The static rank of a page provides a general indicator to the overall quality of the page.', 'The more accurate the static rank, the better this early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the search engine may respond to queries.', 'Among other factors, the static rank of a page is used to determine this prioritization.', 'A better static rank thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date index.', 'Due to this (and possibly due to Google\"s promotion of PageRank to the public), PageRank is widely regarded as the best method for the static ranking of Web pages.', 'We combine these and other static features using machine learning to achieve a ranking system that is significantly better than PageRank (in pairwise agreement with human labels).', 'A machine learning approach for static ranking has other advantages besides the quality of the ranking.', 'Because the measure consists of many features, it is harder for malicious users to manipulate it (i.e., to raise their page\"s static rank to an undeserved level through questionable techniques, also known as Web spamming).', 'A machine learning approach to static ranking is also able to take advantage of any advances in the machine learning field.', 'For example, recent work on adversarial classification [12] suggests that it may be possible to explicitly model the Web page spammer\"s (the adversary) actions, adjusting the ranking model in advance of the spammer\"s attempts to circumvent it.', 'By moving static ranking to a machine learning framework, we not only gain in accuracy, but also gain in the ability to react to spammer\"s actions, to rapidly add new features to the ranking algorithm, and to leverage advances in the rapidly growing field of machine learning.', 'A machine learning approach thus allows rapid development of a good static algorithm in new domains.', 'In Section 3 we introduce RankNet, the machine learning technique used to combine static features into a final ranking.', 'RANKNET Much work in machine learning has been done on the problems of classification and regression.', 'Static ranking can be seen as a regression problem.',

RankNet [7], one of the aforementioned techniques for learning ranking functions, to learn our static rank function.', 'FEATURES To apply RankNet (or other machine learning techniques) to the ranking problem, we needed to extract a set of features from each page.', 'Such data was used by the search engine Direct Hit, and has recently been explored for dynamic ranking purposes [20].', 'Also, to our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of actual page visitation popularity for static ranking.', 'The closest similar work is on using click-through behavior (that is, which search engine results the users click on) to affect dynamic ranking (see e.g., [20]).', 'EXPERIMENTS In this section, we will demonstrate that we can out perform PageRank by applying machine learning to a straightforward set of features.', 'This bias is good when evaluating the quality of static ranking for the purposes of index ordering and returning relevant documents.', 'The goal for a static ranking algorithm will be to reproduce this ordering as closely as possible.', 'If S(x) is the static ranking assigned to page x, and H(x) is the human judgment of relevance for x, then consider the

derived distance measures may be good in general but only a quantitative analysis is capable to identify the best distance measure for a specific feature extraction method.', 'Section 2 gives a

similarity measurement on visual information aims at imitating human visual similarity perception.', 'The common approach in visual information retrieval is measuring dis-similarity as distance.', 'Still, distance measurement is the most important first step in similarity measurement.', 'Unfortunately, these measures do not fit ideally with human similarity perception (e.g.', 'Descriptions in

(3) the model is easy to use and finally, (4) the new parameter p allows to control the similarity measurement process in a new way (discriminance on property level).', 'Obviously, one important distance measure is missing.', 'Additionally, the recommended MPEG-7 distances were implemented with the following parameters: In the distance measure of the Color Layout descriptor all weights were set to \"1\" (as in all other implemented measures).', 'In the distance measure of the Dominant Color descriptor the following parameters were used: 20,1,3.0,7.0 21 ==== dTww α (as recommended).', 'The motion descriptors were not used, because they integrate the temporal dimension of visual media and would only be comparable, if the basic colour, texture and shape descriptors would be aggregated over time.', 'Of course, for identifying the best distance measure for a descriptor, it should be tested on an infinite number of media objects.', 'Even though it is nearly impossible to say, how big the influence of a single distance measure was on the resulting recall and precision values, this problem has been almost ignored so far.', 'In Subsection 2.2 it was stated that the major task of a distance measure is to bring the relevant media objects as close to the origin (where the query object lies) as possible.', 'Identifying clusters of similar objects (based on the given ground truth) is relatively easy, because the resulting distance space for one descriptor and any distance measure is always one-dimensional.', 'The resulting indicator is normalised by the

on this information our query selection algorithm can then select the best queries that cover the content of the Web site.', 'We present our prediction method and our query selection algorithm in Section 3.', '2.3.1 Performance Metric Before we present our ideas for the query selection problem, we briefly discuss some of our notation and the cost/performance metrics.', 'The adaptive policy, however, may perform significantly better than the generic-frequency policy if the database has a very specialized collection that is different from the generic corpus.', 'In Figure 6, we show the query selection function that uses the concept of efficiency.', 'Second, the query selection method that we presented in Section 3.2 assumes that for every potential query qi, we can find P(qi|q1 ∨ ·

of each site, we compare the various selection policies that were described in section 3, namely the random, generic-frequency, and adaptive algorithms.', 'The adaptive algorithm learns new keywords and terms from the documents that it downloads, and its selection process is driven by a cost model as described in Section 3.2.', 'In addition, we use the independence estimator (Section 3.1) to estimate P(qi) from downloaded pages.', 'Although the independence estimator is a simple estimator, our experiments will show that it can work very well in practice.6 For the generic-frequency policy, we compute the frequency distribution of words that appear in a 5.5-million-Web-page corpus 5 Throughout our experiments, once an algorithm has submitted a query to a database, we exclude the query from subsequent submissions to the same database from the same algorithm.', 'In order to further investigate how the quality of the potential query-term list affects the random-based algorithm, we construct two sets: one with the 16, 000 most frequent words of the term collection used in the generic-frequency policy (hereafter, the random policy with the set of 16,000 words will be referred to as random-16K), and another set with the 1 million most frequent words of the same collection as above (hereafter, referred to as random-1M).', 'The generic keyword field is used for searching, and as input to the adaptive policy we extract the product description and the text of customer reviews when present in the XML reply.', 'We consider each indexed link together with its brief summary as the document of the dmoz site, and we provide the short summaries to the adaptive algorithm to drive the selection of new keywords for querying.', 'For example, for the PubMed site (Figure 9), the adaptive algorithm issues only 83 queries to download almost 80% of the documents stored in PubMed, but the generic-frequency algorithm requires 106 queries for the same coverage,.', 'For the

these pages are represented by the subgraph L.

iteration of the FindGlobalPR algorithm, we evaluate performance by computing the difference between the current PageRank estimate of the local domain, ELf ELf 1 , and the global PageRank of the local domain ELg ELg 1 .', 'For each of these site-specific domains with size n, we performed 50 iterations of the FindGlobalPR algorithm to crawl a total of 2n additional nodes.', 'As with the ‘edu\" local domains, we ran our algorithm for 50 iterations, crawling a total of 2n nodes.', 'This yielded a local domain of 90,811 pages, and the results are given in figure 2 (c).', 'Because of the larger size of the topic-specific domains, we ran our algorithm for only 25 iterations to crawl a total of n nodes.', 'For each sub-topic, we set the local domain to be all pages within three links from the corresponding dmoz category pages.', 'To quantify a global page j\"s effect on the global PageRank values of pages in the local domain, we define page j\"s impact to be its PageRank value, g[j], normalized by the fraction of its outlinks pointing to the local domain: impact(j) = oL[j] o[j] · g[j], where, oL[j] is the number of outlinks from page j to pages in the local domain L, and o[j] is the total number of j\"s outlinks.', 'RELATED WORK The node selection framework we have proposed is similar to the url ordering for crawling problem proposed by Cho et al.', 'They propose several node selection algorithms, including the outlink count heuristic, as well as a variant of our PF-Select algorithm which they refer to as the ‘PageRank ordering metric\".', 'Using their algorithm for our problem would require that either the entire global domain first be downloaded or a connectivity server be used, both of which would lead to very large web graphs.', 'In this work, we contend that the use of global PageRank in a localized search engine can improve performance.', 'This method crawls nodes that will most significantly impact the local domain and has running time linear in the number of nodes in the local domain.', 'Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms other existing heuristics.', 'One way to integrate these pages into our framework is to start the FindGlobalPR algorithm with the current subgraph F equal to the set of pages that were crawled by the focused crawler.', 'If the number of iterations T is relatively small compared to the number of pages crawled per iteration, k, then the bottleneck of the algorithm will be the crawling phase.', 'Recall that the FindGlobalPR algorithm (Algorithm 2) requires that the PageRanks of the current expanded local domain be recomputed in each iteration.', 'Recent work by Langville and Meyer [12] gives an algorithm to quickly recompute PageRanks of a given webgraph if a small number of nodes are added.', 'This algorithm was shown to give speedup of five to ten times on some datasets.'], ['In this work, we attempt to capture the rich structure of events and their dependencies in a news topic

our work, we represent an event by a set of stories that discuss it.', 'Following the assumption of atomicity of a story, this means that any set of distinct events can be represented by a set of non-overlapping clusters of news stories.', 'Thus a topic can be represented by clusters of stories each representing an event and a set of (directed or undirected) edges between pairs of these clusters representing the dependencies between these events.', 'Event threading: Event threading detects events within in a topic, and also captures the dependencies among the events.', 'Thus the main difference between event threading and TDT is that we focus our modeling effort on microscopic events rather than larger topics.', 'Additionally event threading models the relatedness or dependencies between pairs of events in a topic while TDT models topics as unrelated clusters of stories.', 'We define a set of events ½ ¡ ¡ ¡ Ñ with the following constraints: ¾ ¾ Ë (1) × Ø (2) × ¾ × Ø × ¾ (3)

is crucial to web search and to information retrieval in general.', 'At the same time, millions of people interact daily with web search engines, providing valuable implicit feedback through their interactions with the search results.', 'If we could turn these interactions into relevance judgments, we could obtain large amounts of data for evaluating, maintaining, and improving information retrieval systems.', 'Recently, automatic or implicit relevance feedback has developed into an active area of research in the information retrieval community, at least in part due to an increase in available resources and to the rising popularity of web search.', '• Extensions of existing clickthrough strategies to include richer browsing and interaction features (Section 4).', 'Oard and Kim [15] studied whether implicit feedback could substitute for explicit ratings in recommender systems.', 'They found that clickthrough was the most important individual variable but that predictive accuracy could be improved by using additional variables, notably dwell time on a page.', 'Joachims [9] developed valuable insights into the collection of implicit measures, introducing a technique based entirely on clickthrough data to learn ranking functions.', '[10] presented an empirical evaluation of interpreting clickthrough evidence.', 'By performing eye tracking studies and correlating predictions of their strategies with explicit ratings, the authors showed that it is possible to accurately interpret clickthrough events in a controlled, laboratory setting.', 'In general, individual user behavior, clickthrough and otherwise, is noisy, and cannot be relied upon for accurate relevance judgments.', 'Figure 3.1 shows the relative clickthrough frequency as a function of result position.', 'We now introduce our techniques for going beyond the clickthrough statistics and explicitly modeling post-search user behavior.', 'Although clickthrough distributions are heavily biased towards top results, we have just shown how the ‘relevance-driven\" click distribution can be recovered by correcting for the prior, background distribution.', 'More formally, we postulate that the observed value o of a feature f for a query q and result r can be expressed as a mixture of two components: ),,()(),,( frqrelfCfrqo += (1) where )( fC is the prior background distribution for values of f aggregated across all queries, and rel(q,r,f) is the component of the behavior influenced by the relevance of the result r. As illustrated above with the clickthrough feature, if we subtract the background distribution (i.e., the expected clickthrough for a result at a given position) from the observed clickthrough frequency at a given position, we can approximate the relevance component of the clickthrough value1 .', 'For example, we compute how long users dwell on a page (TimeOnPage) or domain (TimeOnDomain), and the deviation of dwell time from expected page dwell time for a query.', 'These features allows us to model intra-query diversity of page browsing behavior (e.g., navigational queries, on average, are likely to have shorter page dwell time than transactional or informational queries).', 'We attempt to learn a general implicit feedback interpretation strategy automatically instead of relying on heuristics or insights.', 'Our general approach is to train a classifier to induce weights for the user behavior features, and consequently derive a predictive model of user preferences.', 'As clickthroughs are just one aspect of user interaction, we extend the relevance estimation by introducing a machine learning model that incorporates clicks as well as other aspects of user behavior, such as follow-up queries and page dwell time (Section 4.3).', 'The general approach for using our clickthrough models directly is to filter clicks to those that reflect higher-than-chance click frequency.', 'For this, we estimate the relevance component rel(q,r,f) of the observed clickthrough feature f as the deviation from the expected (background) clickthrough distribution )( fC .', 'Strategy CD (deviation d): For a given query, compute the observed click frequency distribution o(r, p) for all results r in positions p.

For each pair of results ri and rj, predict preference of ri over rj iff dev(ri,pi)-dev(ri,pj)>m.', 'CDiff is a generalization of the clickthrough frequency model of CD, but it ignores the positional information used in CD.', '4.3 General User Behavior Model The strategies described in the previous section generate orderings based solely on observed clickthrough frequencies.', 'As we discussed, clickthrough is just one, albeit important, aspect of user interactions with web search engine results.', 'Relative user preferences are then estimated using the learned user behavior model described in Section 3.4.', 'Recall that to learn a predictive behavior model we used the features from Table 3.1 along with explicit relevance judgments as input to RankNet which learns an optimal weighting of features to predict preferences.', 'We discuss other applications of our models beyond web search ranking in Section 7.', 'We compared our UserBehavior model (Section 4.3) to previously published implicit feedback interpretation techniques and some variants of these approaches (Section 4.2), and to the current search engine ranking based on query and page features alone (Section 4.1).', 'Specifically, we compare the following strategies: • SA: The Skip Above clickthrough strategy (Section 4.2) • SA+N: A more comprehensive extension of SA that takes better advantage of current search engine ranking.', '• CD: Our refinement of SA+N that takes advantage of our mixture model of clickthrough distribution to select trusted clicks for interpretation (Section 4.2).', '• CDiff: Our generalization of the CD strategy that explicitly uses the relevance component of clickthrough probabilities to induce preferences between search results (Section 4.2).', 'In contrast, our clickthrough distribution-based techniques CD and CD+CDiff exhibit somewhat higher precision than SA and SA+N (0.648 and 0.717 at Recall of 0.08, maximum achieved by SA or SA+N).', 'However, even the CD+CDiff clickthrough interpretation strategy can be improved upon by automatically learning to interpret the aggregated clickthrough evidence.', 'To further analyze the value of different dimensions of implicit feedback modeled by the UserBehavior strategy, we consider each group of features in isolation.', 'Our clickthrough and user behavior interpretation strategies rely on extensive user interaction data.', 'Because of the skewed distribution of user clicks our clickthrough-only strategies have high precision, but low recall (i.e., do not attempt to predict relevance of many search results).', 'Nevertheless, our CD+CDiff clickthrough strategy outperforms most recent state-of-the-art results by a large margin (0.72 precision for CD+CDiff vs. 0.64 for SA+N) at the highest recall level of SA+N.', 'Furthermore, by considering the comprehensive UserBehavior features that model user interactions after the search and beyond the initial click, we can achieve substantially higher precision and recall than considering clickthrough alone.', 'Our UserBehavior strategy achieves recall of over 0.43 with precision of over 0.67 (with much higher precision at lower recall levels), substantially outperforms the current search engine preference ranking and all other implicit feedback interpretation methods.', 'We introduced new, robust, probabilistic techniques for interpreting clickthrough evidence by aggregating across users and queries.', 'Our methods result in clickthrough interpretation substantially more accurate than previously published results not specifically designed for web search scenarios.', 'By considering the complete search experience after the initial query and click, we demonstrated prediction accuracy far exceeding that of interpreting only the limited clickthrough information.', 'Furthermore, we showed that automatically learning to interpret user behavior results in substantially better performance than the human-designed ad-hoc clickthrough interpretation strategies.', 'For example, the user behavior model on intranet search may be different from the web search behavior.', 'A natural application of our preference prediction models is to improve web search ranking [1].', 'While our techniques perform well on average, our assumptions about clickthrough distributions (and learning the user behavior models) may not hold equally well for all queries.'], [' Robustness of Adaptive Filtering Methods In a Cross-benchmark Evaluation Yiming Yang, Shinjae Yoo, Jian Zhang, Bryan Kisiel School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA ABSTRACT This paper reports a cross-benchmark evaluation of regularized logistic regression (LR) and incremental Rocchio for adaptive filtering.', 'Using systematic cross-corpus parameter optimization with both methods, we obtained the best results ever reported on TDT5, TREC10 and TREC11.', '• Relevance feedback (RF) was not allowed in the TDT evaluations for AF (or topic tracking in the TDT terminology) until 2004.', 'These conditions make adaptive filtering a difficult task in statistical learning (online classification), for the following reasons: 1) it is difficult to learn accurate models for prediction based on extremely sparse training data; 2) it is not obvious how to correct the sampling bias (i.e., relevance feedback on system-accepted documents only) during the adaptation process; 3) it is not well understood how to effectively tune parameters in AF methods using cross-corpus validation where the validation and evaluation topics do not overlap, and the documents may be from different sources or different epochs.', 'None of these problems is addressed in the literature of statistical learning for batch classification where all the training data are given at once.', 'The first two problems have been studied in the adaptive filtering literature, including topic profile adaptation using incremental Rocchio, Gaussian-Exponential density models, logistic regression in a Bayesian framework, etc., and threshold optimization strategies using probabilistic calibration or local fitting techniques [1][2][9][10][11][12][13].', 'Although these works provide valuable insights for understanding the problems and possible solutions, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness and robustness of current methods because the third problem has not been thoroughly investigated.', 'We argue that robustness is an important measure for evaluating and comparing AF methods.', 'By robust we mean consistent and strong performance across benchmark corpora with a systematic method for parameter tuning across multiple corpora.', 'This leaves only one option (assuming tuning on the test set is not an alternative), that is, choosing an external corpus as the validation set.', 'Current literature does not offer an answer because no thorough investigation on the robustness of AF methods has been reported.', 'In this paper we address the above question by conducting a cross-benchmark evaluation with two effective approaches in AF: incremental Rocchio and regularized logistic regression (LR).', 'It was recently evaluated in adaptive filtering and was found to have relatively strong performance (Section 5.1).', 'Stimulated by those findings, we decided to include Rocchio and LR in our crossbenchmark evaluation for robustness testing.', 'TREC10 was the evaluation benchmark for adaptive filtering in TREC 2001, consisting of roughly 806,791 Reuters news stories from August 1996 to August 1997 with 84 topic labels (subject categories)[7].', 'TREC11 was the evaluation benchmark for adaptive filtering in TREC 2002, consisting of the same set of documents as those in TREC10 but with a slightly different splitting point for the training and test sets.', 'The granularity differences among topics and the corresponding non-stationary distributions make the cross-benchmark evaluation interesting.', 'Cross-benchmark evaluations allow us to test this hypothesis and possibly identify the weaknesses in current approaches to adaptive filtering in tracking the drifting trends of topics.', '1 http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Projects/TDT2001/topics.html Table 1: Statistics of benchmark corpora for adaptive filtering evaluations N(tr) is the number of the initial training documents; N(ts) is the number of the test documents; n+ is the number of positive examples of a predefined topic; * is an average over all the topics.', '3.2 TDT metrics The TDT-conventional metric for topic tracking is defined as: famisstrk PTPwPTPwTC ))(1()()( 21 −+= where P(T) is the percentage of documents on topic T, missP is the miss rate by the system on that topic, faP is the false alarm rate, and 1w and 2w are the costs (pre-specified constants) for a miss and a false alarm, respectively.', 'To make the intuition behind this measure transparent, we substitute the terms in the definition of Ctrk as follows: N CA TP + =)( , N DB TP + =− )(1 , CA C Pmiss + = , DB B Pfa + = , )( 1 )( 21 21 BwCw N DB B N DB w CA C N CA wTCtrk +⋅= + ⋅ + ⋅+ + ⋅ + ⋅= Clearly, trkC is the average cost per error on topic T, with 1w and 2w controlling the penalty ratio for misses vs. false alarms.', 'That is, Ctrk has a very different penalty ratio for misses vs. false alarms: it favors recall-oriented systems to an extreme.', 'At first glance, one would think that the penalty ratio in Ctrk is 10:1 since 11 =w and 1.02 =w .', 'Using 02.0)(ˆ =TP as an (inaccurate) estimate of 0.002 enlarges the intended penalty ratio of 10:1 to 100:1, roughly speaking.', 'Comparing the above result to formula 2, we can see the actual penalty ratio for misses vs. false alarms was 100:1 in the evaluations on TDT3 using Ctrk.', 'Similarly, we can compute the enlargement factor for TDT5 using the statistics in Table 1 as follows: 3.58 991,207/3.71 02.0 )( )(ˆ === TP TP ρ which means the actual penalty ratio for misses vs. false alarms in the evaluation on TDT5 using Ctrk was approximately 583:1.', 'The implications of the above analysis are rather significant: • Ctrk defined in the same formula does not necessarily mean the same objective function in evaluation; instead, the optimization criterion depends on the test corpus.', '• Results in Ctrk in the past years of TDT evaluations may not be directly comparable to each other because the evaluation collections changed most years and hence the penalty ratio in Ctrk varied.', 'Comparing the metrics in TDT and TREC from a utility or cost optimization point of view is important for understanding the evaluation results of adaptive filtering methods.', 'If relevance feedback is available (as is the case in TREC adaptive filtering), the new document is added to the pool of either )(TD+ or )(TD− , and the prototype is recomputed accordingly; if relevance feedback is not available (as is the case in TDT event tracking), the system\"s prediction (yes) is treated as the truth, and the new document is added to )(TD+ for updating the prototype.', 'The simplest is to use a universal threshold for all topics, tuned on a validation set and fixed during the testing phase.', 'More elaborate methods include probabilistic threshold calibration which converts the non-probabilistic similarity scores to probabilities (i.e., )|( dTP r ) for utility optimization [9][13], and margin-based local regression for risk reduction [11].', 'Instead, our focus here is to investigate the robustness of Rocchio-style methods in terms of how much their performance depends on elaborate system tuning, and how difficult (or how easy) it is to get good performance through cross-corpus parameter optimization.', 'This simple version of Rocchio has been commonly used in the past TDT benchmark evaluations for topic tracking, and had strong performance in the TDT2004 evaluations for adaptive filtering with and without relevance feedback (Section 5.1).', '4.2 Logistic Regression for AF Logistic regression (LR) estimates the posterior probability of a topic given a document using a sigmoid

for LR is 33.0)12/(1 =+ for all topics.', 'EVALUATIONS We report our empirical findings in four parts: the TDT2004 official evaluation results, the cross-corpus parameter optimization results, and the results corresponding to the amounts of relevance feedback.', '5.1 TDT2004 benchmark results The TDT2004 evaluations for adaptive filtering were conducted by NIST in November 2004.', 'Our Rocchio (with adaptive profiles but fixed universal threshold for all topics) had the best result in Ctrk, and our logistic regression had the best result in TDT5SU.', 'Adaptive filtering without using true relevance feedback was also a part of the evaluations.', 'Given that we only have one labeled example per topic in the TDT5 training sets, it is impossible to effectively optimize these parameters on the training data, and we had to choose an external corpus for validation.', 'Given the penalty ratio for misses vs. false alarms as 2:1 in T11SU, 10:1 in TDT5SU and 583:1 in Ctrk (Section 3.3), the corresponding optimal thresholds (t) are 0.33, 0.091 and 0.0017 respectively.', 'More importantly, our cross-benchmark evaluation gives strong evidence for the robustness of LR.', 'Moreover, logistic regression is known to converge towards the Bayes classifier asymptotically while Rocchio classifiers\" parameters do not.', 'This observation does not support the previous report by [13], but we are not surprised because we are not convinced that Rocchio prototypes are more accurate than LR models for topics in the early stage of the AF process, and we believe that using a Rocchio prototype as the mean in the Gaussian prior would introduce undesirable bias to LR.', 'In the case of minimizing Ctrk, the safe range for λ is between 0 and 0.1, and setting λ between 0.005 and 0.05 yielded relatively large improvements over the performance of standard LR because training a model for extremely high recall is statistically more tricky, and hence more regularization is needed.', '5.3 Percentages of labeled data How much relevance feedback (RF) would be needed during the AF process is a meaningful question in real-world applications.', 'To answer it, we evaluated Rocchio and LR on TDT with the following settings: • Basic Rocchio, no adaptation at all • PRF Rocchio, updating topic profiles without using true relevance feedback; • Adaptive Rocchio, updating topic profiles using relevance feedback on system-accepted documents plus 10 documents randomly sampled from the pool of systemrejected documents; • LR with 0 rr =μ , 01.0=λ and threshold = 0.004; • All the parameters in Rocchio tuned on TDT3.', 'Table 3 summarizes the results in Ctrk: Adaptive Rocchio with relevance feedback on 0.6% of the test documents reduced the tracking cost by 54% over the result of the PRF Rocchio, the best system in the TDT2004 evaluation for topic tracking without relevance feedback information.', 'Table 4 summarizes the results in TDT5SU; adaptive LR was the winner in this case, with relevance feedback on 0.05% of the test documents improving the utility by 20.9% over the results of PRF Rocchio.', '5.4 Summary of Adaptation Process After we decided the parameter settings using validation, we perform the adaptive filtering in the following steps for each topic: 1) Train the LR/Rocchio model using the provided positive training examples and 30 randomly sampled negative examples; 2) For each document in the test corpus: we first make a prediction about relevance, and then get relevance feedback for those (predicted) positive documents.', 'CONCLUDING REMARKS We

Microsoft Research brill@microsoft.com Susan Dumais Microsoft Research sdumais@microsoft.com ABSTRACT We show that incorporating user behavior data can significantly improve ordering of top results in real web search setting.', 'We examine alternatives for incorporating feedback into the ranking process and explore the contributions of user feedback compared to other common web search features.', 'We report results of a large scale evaluation over 3,000 queries and 12 million user interactions with a popular web search engine.', 'We show that incorporating implicit feedback can augment other features, improving the accuracy of a competitive web search ranking algorithms by as much as 31% relative to the original performance.', 'These interactions can serve as a valuable source of information for tuning and improving web search result ranking and can compliment more costly explicit judgments.', 'Implicit relevance feedback for ranking and personalization has become an active area of research.', 'Recent work by Joachims and others exploring implicit feedback in controlled environments have shown the value of incorporating implicit feedback into the ranking process.', 'Our motivation for this work is to understand how implicit feedback can be used in a large-scale operational environment to improve retrieval.', 'While it is intuitive that user interactions with the web search engine should reveal at least some information that could be used for ranking, estimating user preferences in real web search settings is a challenging problem, since real user interactions tend to be more noisy than commonly assumed in the controlled settings of previous studies.', 'Our paper explores whether implicit feedback can be helpful in realistic environments, where user feedback can be noisy (or adversarial) and a web search engine already uses hundreds of features and is heavily tuned.', 'To this end, we explore different approaches for ranking web search results using real user behavior obtained as part of normal interactions with the web search engine.', 'The specific contributions of this paper include: • Analysis of alternatives for incorporating user behavior into web search ranking (Section 3).', '• An application of a robust implicit feedback model derived from mining millions of user interactions with a major web search engine (Section 4).', '• A large scale evaluation over real user queries and search results, showing significant improvements derived from incorporating user feedback (Section 6).', 'BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK Ranking search results is a fundamental problem in information retrieval.', 'However, with increasing popularity of search engines, implicit feedback (i.e., the actions users take when interacting with the search engine) can be used to improve the rankings.', 'This research, while developing valuable insights into implicit relevance measures, was not applied to improve the ranking of web search results in realistic settings.', 'Closely related to our work, Joachims [11] collected implicit measures in place of explicit measures, introducing a technique based entirely on clickthrough data to learn ranking functions.', 'However, the modeling effort was aimed at predicting explicit relevance judgments from implicit user actions and not specifically at learning ranking functions.', 'Other studies of user behavior in web search include Pharo and Järvelin [19], but were not directly applied to improve ranking.', 'Unfortunately, the extent to which previous research applies to real-world web search is unclear.', 'At the same time, while recent work (e.g., [26]) on using clickthrough information for improving web search ranking is promising, it captures only one aspect of the user interactions with web search engines.', 'We build on existing research to develop robust user behavior interpretation techniques for the real web search setting.', 'Instead of treating each user as a reliable expert, we aggregate information from multiple, unreliable, user search session traces, as we describe in the next two sections.', 'INCORPORATING IMPLICIT FEEDBACK We consider two complementary approaches to ranking with implicit feedback: (1) treating implicit feedback as independent evidence for ranking results, and (2) integrating implicit feedback features directly into the ranking algorithm.', 'We describe the two general ranking approaches next.', 'The specific implicit feedback features are described in Section 4, and the algorithms for interpreting and incorporating implicit feedback are described in Section 5.', '3.1 Implicit Feedback as Independent Evidence The general approach is to re-rank the results obtained by a web search engine according to observed clickthrough and other user interactions for the query in previous search sessions.', 'Each result is assigned a score according to expected relevance/user satisfaction based on previous interactions, resulting in some preference ordering based on user interactions alone.', 'We found that a simple rank merging heuristic combination works well, and is robust to variations in score values from original rankers.', 'For a given query q, the implicit score ISd is computed for each result d from available user interaction features, resulting in the implicit rank Id for each result.', 'We compute a merged score SM(d) for d by combining the ranks obtained from implicit feedback, Id with the original rank of d, Od:   ¡   ¢ £ + + + + = otherwise O dforexistsfeedbackimplicitif OI w wOIdS d dd I IddM 1 1 1 1 1 1 ),,,( where the weight wI is a heuristically tuned scaling factor representing the relative importance of the implicit feedback.', 'Applying more sophisticated classifier and ranker combination algorithms may result in additional improvements, and is a promising direction for future work.', 'The approach above assumes that there are no interactions between the underlying features producing the original web search ranking and the implicit feedback features.', 'We now relax this assumption by integrating implicit feedback features directly into the ranking process.', '3.2 Ranking with Implicit Feedback Features Modern web search engines rank results based on a large number of features, including content-based features (i.e., how closely a query matches the text or title or anchor text of the document), and query-independent page quality features (e.g., PageRank of the document or the domain).', 'In most cases, automatic (or semiautomatic) methods are developed for tuning the specific ranking function that combines these feature values.', 'Hence, a natural approach is to incorporate implicit feedback features directly as features for the ranking algorithm.', 'At runtime, the search engine would fetch the implicit feedback features associated with each query-result URL pair.', 'This model requires a ranking algorithm to be robust to missing values: more than 50% of queries to web search engines are unique, with no previous implicit feedback available.', '3.3 Learning to Rank Web Search Results A key aspect of our approach is exploiting recent advances in machine learning, namely trainable ranking algorithms for web search and information retrieval (e.g., [5, 11] and classical results reviewed in [3]).', 'In our setting, explicit human relevance judgments (labels) are available for a set of web search queries and results.', 'Hence, an attractive choice to use is a supervised machine learning technique to learn a ranking function that best predicts relevance judgments.', 'While the specific training algorithms used by RankNet are beyond the scope of this paper, it is described in detail in [5] and includes extensive evaluation and comparison with other ranking methods.', 'An attractive feature of RankNet is both train- and run-time efficiency - runtime ranking can be quickly computed and can scale to the web, and training can be done over thousands of queries and associated judged results.', 'Furthermore, RankNet can learn with many (differentiable) cost functions, and hence can automatically learn a ranking function from human-provided labels, an attractive alternative to heuristic feature combination techniques.', 'Hence, we will also use RankNet as a generic ranker to explore the contribution of implicit feedback for different ranking alternatives.', 'IMPLICIT USER FEEDBACK MODEL Our goal is to accurately interpret noisy user feedback obtained as by tracing user interactions with the search engine.', 'Interpreting implicit feedback in real web search setting is not an easy task.', 'The general approach is to represent user actions for each search result as a vector of features, and then train a ranker on these features to discover feature values indicative of relevant (and nonrelevant) search results.', 'We first briefly summarize our features and model, and the learning approach (Section 4.2) in order to provide sufficient information to replicate our ranking methods and the subsequent experiments.', '4.1 Representing User Actions as Features We model observed web search behaviors as a combination of a ``background\"\" component (i.e., query- and relevance-independent noise in user behavior, including positional biases with result interactions), and a ``relevance\"\" component (i.e., query-specific behavior indicative of relevance of a result to a query).', 'The features used to represent user interactions with web search results are summarized in Table 4.1.', 'This information was obtained via opt-in client-side instrumentation from users of a major web search engine.', 'We include the traditional implicit feedback features such as clickthrough counts for the results, as well as our novel derived features such as the deviation of the observed clickthrough number for a given query-URL pair from the expected number of clicks on a result in the given position.', 'We also model the browsing behavior after a result was clicked - e.g., the average page dwell time for a given query-URL pair, as well as its deviation from the expected (average) dwell time.', 'Furthermore, the feature set was designed to provide essential information about the user experience to make feedback interpretation robust.', 'For example, web search users can often determine whether a result is relevant by looking at the result title, URL, and summary - in many cases, looking at the original document is not necessary.', 'To model this aspect of user experience we include features such as overlap in words in title and words in query (TitleOverlap) and the fraction of words shared by the query and the result summary.', 'Clickthrough features Position Position of the URL in Current ranking ClickFrequency Number of clicks for this query, URL pair ClickProbability Probability of a click for this query and URL ClickDeviation Deviation from expected click

features used to represent post-search navigation history for a given query and search result URL.', 'Having described our feature set, we briefly review our general method for deriving a user behavior model.', 'We find all the instances in our session logs where these queries were submitted to the search engine, and aggregate the user behavior features for all search sessions involving these queries.', 'These labeled feature vectors are used as input to the RankNet training algorithm (Section 3.3) which produces a trained user behavior model.', 'The resulting user behavior model is used to help rank web search resultseither directly or in combination with other features, as described below.', 'EXPERIMENTAL SETUP The ultimate goal of incorporating implicit feedback into ranking is to improve the relevance of the returned web search results.', 'Hence, we compare the ranking methods over a large set of judged queries with explicit relevance labels provided by human judges.', 'In order for the evaluation to be realistic we obtained a random sample of queries from web search logs of a major search engine, with associated results and traces for user actions.', 'Our metrics are described in Section 5.2 that we use to evaluate the ranking alternatives, listed in Section 5.3 in the experiments of Section 6.', '5.1 Datasets We compared our ranking methods over a random sample of 3,000 queries from the search engine query logs.', 'Note that the experiments were performed over the results already highly ranked by a web search engine, which corresponds to a typical user experience which is limited to the small number of the highly ranked results for a typical web search query.', 'The data consisted of user interactions with the web search engine (e.g., clicking on a result link, going back to search results, etc.)', '5.2 Evaluation Metrics We evaluate the ranking algorithms over a range of accepted information retrieval metrics, namely Precision at K (P(K)), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and Mean Average Precision (MAP).', 'In our setting, we require a relevant document to be labeled Good or higher.', '• NDCG at K: NDCG is a retrieval measure devised specifically for web search evaluation [10].', 'For a given query q, the ranked results are examined from the top ranked down, and the NDCG computed as:  = +−= K j jr qq jMN 1 )( )1log(/)12( Where Mq is a normalization constant calculated so that a perfect ordering would obtain NDCG of 1; and each r(j) is an integer relevance label (0=Bad and 5=Perfect) of result returned at

BM25F variant we used for our experiments computes separate match scores for each field for a result document (e.g., body text, title, and anchor text), and incorporates query-independent linkbased information (e.g., PageRank, ClickDistance, and URL depth).', 'Note that BM25F does not directly consider explicit or implicit feedback for tuning.', '• RN: The ranking produced by a neural net ranker

system automatically learns weights for all features (including the BM25F score for a document) based on explicit human labels for a large set of queries.', 'A system incorporating an implementation of RankNet is currently in use by a major search engine and can be considered representative of the state of the art in web search.', '• BM25F-RerankCT: The ranking produced by incorporating

['Unlike standard topic-driven text classification, action-item detection requires inferring the sender\"s intent, and as such responds less well to pure bag-of-words classification.', 'However, using enriched feature sets, such as n-grams (up to n=4) with chi-squared feature selection, and contextual cues for action-item location improve performance by up to 10% over unigrams, using in both cases state of the art classifiers such as SVMs with automated model selection via embedded cross-validation.', 'INTRODUCTION E-mail users are facing an increasingly difficult task of managing their inboxes in the face of mounting challenges that result from rising e-mail usage.', 'Automated action-item detection targets the third of these problems by attempting to detect which e-mails require an action or response with information, and within those e-mails, attempting to highlight the sentence (or other passage length) that directly indicates the action request.', 'Such a detection system can be used as one part of an e-mail agent which would assist a user in processing important e-mails quicker than would have been possible without the agent.', 'We view action-item detection as one necessary component of a successful e-mail agent which would perform spam detection, action-item detection, topic classification and priority ranking, among other functions.', 'Action-item detection differs from standard text classification in two important ways.', 'In contrast, standard text categorization merely assigns a topic label to each text, whether that label corresponds to an e-mail folder or a controlled indexing vocabulary [12, 15, 22].', 'Second, action-item detection attempts to recover the email sender\"s intent - whether she means to elicit response or action on the part of the receiver; note that for this task, classifiers using only unigrams as features do not perform optimally, as evidenced in our results below.', 'We believe that action-item detection is one of the first clear instances of an IR-related task where we must move beyond bag-of-words to achieve high performance, albeit not too far, as bag-of-n-grams seem to suffice.', 'We first review related work for similar text classification problems such as e-mail priority ranking and speech act identification.', 'Then we more formally define the action-item detection problem, discuss the aspects that distinguish it from more common problems like topic classification, and highlight the challenges in constructing systems that can perform well at the sentence and document level.', 'From there, we move to a discussion of feature representation and selection techniques appropriate for this problem and how standard text classification approaches can be adapted to smoothly move from the sentence-level detection problem to the documentlevel classification problem.', 'RELATED WORK Several other researchers have considered very similar text classification tasks.', '[5] describe an ontology of speech acts, such as Propose a Meeting, and attempt to predict when an e-mail contains one of these speech acts.', 'We consider action-items to be an important specific type of speech act that falls within their more general classification.', '[6] consider detecting items in e-mail to Put on a To-Do List.', 'Interest in a variety of learning tasks related to e-mail has been rapidly growing in the recent literature.', 'For example, in a forum dedicated to e-mail learning tasks, Culotta et al.', 'Additionally, we consider multiple standard text classification approaches and analyze both the quantitative and qualitative differences that arise from taking a document-level vs. a sentence-level approach to classification.', '3.1 Problem Definition In order to provide the most benefit to the user, a system would not only detect the document, but it would also indicate the specific sentences in the e-mail which contain the action-items.', 'Finally, sentence detection plays a role in both timepressure situations and simply to alleviate the user\"s required time to gist the message.', 'The document-level view treats each e-mail as a learning instance with an associated class-label.', 'Applying a document-level classifier to document detection and ranking is straightforward.', 'The obvious benefit of the document-level approach is that training set collection costs are lower since the user only has to specify whether or not an e-mail contains an action-item and not the specific sentences.', 'In the sentence-level view, each e-mail is automatically segmented into sentences, and each sentence is treated as a learning instance with an associated class-label.', 'Once trained, applying the resulting classifiers to sentence detection is now straightforward, but in order to apply the classifiers to document detection and document ranking, the individual predictions over each sentence must be aggregated in order to make a document-level prediction.', 'This approach has the potential to benefit from morespecific labels that enable the learner to focus attention on the key sentences instead of having to learn based on data that the majority of the words in the e-mail provide no or little information about class membership.', 'When using n-grams, if we find an n-gram of size 4 in a segment of text, we can represent the text as just one occurrence of the ngram or as one occurrence of the n-gram and an occurrence of each smaller n-gram contained by it.', 'Assuming proper punctuation, these extra tokens are unnecessary, but often e-mail lacks proper punctuation.', 'Once a sentence-level classifier has made a prediction for each sentence, we must combine these predictions to make both a document-level prediction and a document-level score.', 'The messages were anonymized by replacing the names of each individual and institution with a pseudonym.1 After attempting to identify and eliminate duplicate e-mails, the corpus contains 744 e-mail messages.', 'Quoted material refers to the text of a previous e-mail that an author often leaves in an e-mail message when responding to the e-mail.', 'Additionally, the hand-stripped version has had any xml content and e-mail signatures removed - leaving only the essential content of the message.', 'In addition, they identified each segment of the e-mail which contained an action-item.', '4.2 Classifiers For this experiment, we have selected a variety of standard text classification algorithms.', 'Different levels of feature selection were considered for each classifier.', 'For this study, only the body of each e-mail message was used.', 'That is, for the n-gram representation, the n-grams and position features are also subject to removal by the feature selection method.', 'This difference in performance produced by the n-gram representation is statistically significant for each classifier except for na¨ıve Bayes and the accuracy metric for kNN (see Table 4).', 'Na¨ıve Bayes poor performance with the n-gram representation is not surprising since the bag-of-n-grams causes excessive doublecounting as mentioned in Section 3.2.1; however, na¨ıve Bayes is not hurt at the sentence-level because the sparse examples provide few chances for agglomerative effects of double counting.', 'More importantly for the n-gram hypothesis, the n-grams lead to the best document-level classifier performance as well.', 'As would be expected, the difference between the sentence-level n-gram representation and unigram representation is small.', 'Therefore, the finer-grained sentence-level judgments allows a unigram representation to succeed but only when performed in a small window - behaving as an n-gram representation for all practical purposes.', 'F1 Winner Accuracy Winner kNN Sentence Sentence na¨ıve Bayes Sentence Sentence SVM Sentence Sentence Voted Perceptron Sentence Document Table 5: Significance results for sentence-level classifiers vs. document-level classifiers for the document detection problem.', 'Further highlighting the improvement from finer-grained judgments and n-grams, Figure 3 graphically depicts the edge the SVM sentence-level classifier has over the standard bag-of-words approach with a precision-recall curve.', 'In the high precision area of the graph, the consistent edge of the sentence-level classifier is rather impressive - continuing at precision 1 out to 0.1 recall.', 'With regard to the sentence detection problem, we note that the F1 measure gives a better feel for the remaining room for improvement in this difficult problem.', 'That is, unlike document detection where actionitem documents are fairly common, action-item sentences are very rare.', 'Although, the results here are significantly above-random, it is unclear what level of performance is necessary for sentence detection to be useful in and of itself and not simply as a means to document ranking and classification.', 'In order to demonstrate the impact this task can have on e-mail users, we conducted a user study using an earlier less-accurate version of the sentence classifier - where instead of using just a single sentence, a threesentence windowed-approach was used.', 'There were three distinct sets of e-mail in which users had to find action-items.', 'Since the user studies used a three sentence window, we believe this played a role as well as sentence detection accuracy.', 'Additionally, action-item detection is distinct from many text classification tasks in that a single sentence can change the class label of the document.', 'Even though we discarded the header information, examining the top-ranked features at the document-level reveals that many of the features are names or parts of e-mail addresses that occurred in the body and are highly associated with e-mails that tend to contain many or no action-items.', 'When finer-grained judgments are available, then a standard bag-of-words approach using a small (sentence) window size and automatic segmentation techniques can produce results almost as good as the n-gram based approaches.', 'Making large-scale svm learning practical.', 'An evaluation of phrasal and clustered representations on a text categorization task.', 'A comparison study of kernels for multi-label text

the amount of labeled data needed to reach the same performance as when new labels are requested randomly [17].', 'Since many text classification tasks often have very little training data, we focus on parametric methods.', 'Additionally, these models can be interpreted as assuming the scores produced by the text classifier have three basic types of empirical behavior - one corresponding to each

noisy class labels to produce probabilities from the raw output of an SVM.', 'PROBLEM DEFINITION & APPROACH Our work differs from earlier approaches primarily in three points: (1) We provide asymmetric parametric models suitable for use when little training data is available; (2) We explicitly analyze the quality of probability estimates these and competing methods produce and provide significance tests for these results; (3) We target text classifier outputs where a majority of the previous literature targeted the output of search engines.', 'A text classifier produces a

solved through combinatorial auctions.', 'It is an increasing price combinatorial auction that naturally distributes the problem of winner determination amongst the bidders in such a way that they have an incentive to perform the calculation.', 'In this paper we present our bidding algorithms, discuss their virtues and drawbacks, and compare the solutions obtained by them to the revenue-maximizing solution found by a centralized winner determination algorithm.', 'In a combinatorial auction bidders can place bids on combinations of items, called packages or bidsets, rather than just individual items.', 'This problem, known as the winner determination problem, is a combinatorial optimization problem and is NP-Hard [10].', 'pausebid performs a branch and bound search completely from scratch every time that it is called.', 'Since in the final round all agents consider all possible bidsets, we know that the final winning bidset will be one such that no agent can propose a better bidset.', 'That is, the final prices will not be the same as the prices in a traditional combinatorial auction where all the bidders bid their true valuation.', 'Each agent must search over the space of all bidsets which contain at least one of its bids.', 'The search is made easier by the fact that the agent needs to consider only the current best bids and only wants bidsets where its own utility is higher than in the current winning bidset.', 'Each agent also has a clear incentive for performing this computation, namely, its utility only increases with each bidset it proposes (of course, it might decrease with the bidsets that others propose).', 'We can even envision completely eliminating the auctioneer and, instead, have every agent perform the task of the auctioneer.', 'That is, all bids are broadcast and when an agent receives a bid from another agent it updates the set of best bids and determines if the new bid is indeed better than the current winning bid.', 'Also, any lies about other agents\" bids are easily found out by keeping track of the bids sent out by every agent (the set of best bids).', 'Namely, the only one that can increase an agent\"s bid value is the agent itself.', 'Anyone claiming a higher value for some other agent is lying.', 'PROBLEM FORMULATION A bid b is composed of three elements bitems (the set of items the bid is over), bagent (the agent that placed the bid), and bvalue (the value or price of the bid).', 'If the agent is not winning any items then its utility is zero.', 'Formally, given that W is the current winning bidset, agent i must find a g∗ i such that r(g∗ i ) ≥ r(W) + and g∗ i = arg max g⊆2B ui(g), (3) where each g is a set of bids that covers all items and ∀b∈g (b ∈ B) or (bagent = i and

bid of size ≤ k in which the agent i bids higher than the price for the same items in B.', 'i is the agent and k is the current stage of the auction, for k ≥ 2. the agent can dominate, we start by defining my-bids to be the list of bids for which the agent\"s valuation is higher than the current best bid, as given in B.', 'The agent can now perform a branch and bound search on the branch-on-bids tree produced by these bids.', 'This branch and bound search is implemented by pbsearch (Figure 2).', 'The bound we use is the maximum utility that the agent can expect to receive from a given set of bids.', 'Initially, u∗ is set to ui(W) (pausebid line 11) since that is the utility the agent currently receives and any solution he proposes should give him more utility.', 'If pbsearch ever comes across a partial solution where the maximum utility the agent can expect to receive is less than u∗ then that subtree is pruned (pbsearch line 21).', 'Note that we can determine the maximum utility only after the algorithm has searched over all of the agent\"s own bids (which are first on the list) because after that we know that the solution will not include any more bids where the agent is the winner thus the agent\"s utility will no longer increase.', 'if an agent has only one bid in my-bids then the maximum utility he can expect is equal to his value for the items in that bid minus the minimum possible payment we can make for those items and still come up with a set of bids that has revenue greater than r(W).', 'Similarly to (4) we define hi(S, k) = s∈S max S | size(S )≤k and s∈S and vi(S )>0 vi(S ) size(S ) (5) which assigns to each individual item s in S the maximum value produced by the valuation of S divided by the size of S , where S is a set for which the agent has a valuation greater than zero, contains s, and its size is less or equal than k. The algorithm uses the heuristics h and hi (lines 15 and 19 of pbsearch), to prune the just mentioned branches in the same way an A∗ algorithm uses its heuristic.', 'A final pruning technique implemented by the algorithm is ignoring any branches where the agent has no bids in the current answer g and no more of the agent\"s bids are in the list (pbsearch lines 6 and 7).', 'The resulting g∗ found by pbsearch is thus the set of bids that has revenue bigger than r(W) and maximizes agent i\"s utility.', 'However, agent i\"s bids in g∗ are still set to his own valuation and not to the lowest possible price.', 'If the agent has only one bid in g∗ then it is simply a matter of reducing the payment of that bid by u∗ from the current maximum of the agent\"s true valuation.', 'However, if the agent has more than one bid then we face the problem of how to distribute the agent\"s payments among these bids.', 'The problem is the same; the agent i has to find g∗ i .', 'We note that g∗ i is a bidset that contains at least one bid of the agent i.', 'Let S be a set of items for which the agent i has a valuation such that vi(S) ≥ B(S) > 0, let gS i be a bidset over S such that r(gS i ) ≥ r(W)

in order to determine how their solution compares to the revenue-maximizing solution and how their times compare with each other.', 'It is as if you were told the set of bids placed in a combinatorial auction but not who placed each bid or even how many people placed bids, and then asked to determine the value function of every participant in the auction.', 'We then compared the solutions found by both of them to the revenue-maximizing solution as found by CASS when given a set of bids that corresponds to the agents\" true valuation.', 'That is, for each agent i and each set of items S for which vi(S) > 0 we generated a bid.', 'Note, however, that the revenue from the PAUSE auction on all the auctions is always smaller than the revenue of the revenue-maximizing solution when the agents bid their true valuations.', 'When we compared the solutions of our algorithms to the revenue-maximizing solution, we realized that they do not always find the same distribution of items as the revenue-maximizing solution (as shown in Figure 6).', 'The cases where our algorithms failed to arrive at the distribution of the revenue-maximizing solution are those where there was a large gap between the first and second valuation for a set (or sets) of items.', 'If the revenue-maximizing solution contains the bid (or bids) using these higher valuation then it is impossible for the PAUSE auction to find this solution because that bid (those bids) is never placed.', 'For example, if agent i has vi(1) = 1000 and the second highest valuation for (1) is only 10 then i only needs to place a bid of 11 in order to win that item.', 'If the revenue-maximizing solution requires that 1 be sold for 1000 then that solution will never be found because that bid will never be placed.', 'We also found that average percentage of times that our algorithms converges to the revenue-maximizing solution decreases as the number of items increases.', 'The VSA algorithm [3] is another way of performing distributed winner determination in combinatorial auction but it assumes the bids themselves perform the computation.', 'Their mechanism roughly amounts to having each agent calculate the payments for two other agents and give these to a secure 700 The Sixth Intl.', 'This general idea, which they call the redundancy principle, could also be applied to our problem but it requires the existence of a secure center agent that everyone trusts.', 'The PAUSE auction is one of a few approaches to decentralize the winner determination problem in combinatorial auctions.', 'With this auction, we can even envision completely eliminating the auctioneer and, instead, have every agent performe the task of the auctioneer.', 'pausebid performs a branch and bound search completely from scratch each time it is invoked.', 'cachedpausebid caches partial solutions and performs a branch and bound search only on the few portions affected by the changes on the bids between consecutive

a solution to our negotiation problem.', 'At this stage, we would like to point out the main difference between solving the 0-1 knapsack problem and solving our negotiation problem.', 'On the other hand, our negotiation problem involves two players and they are both strategic.', 'Hence, in our case, it is not enough to just find an approximate solution to the knapsack problem, we must also show that such an approximation forms an equilibrium.', 'The traditional approach for overcoming the computational complexity in finding an equilibrium has been to use an approximate equilibrium (see [14, 26] for example).', 'In this approach, a strategy profile is said to form an approximate Nash equilibrium if neither agent can gain more than the constant by deviating.', 'Hence, our aim is to use the solution to the 0-1 knapsack problem proposed in [10] and show that it forms an approximate equilibrium to our negotiation problem.', 'Before doing so, we give a brief overview of the key ideas that underlie approximation algorithms.', 'The quality of an approximate algorithm is determined by comparing its performance to that of the optimal algorithm and measuring the relative error [3, 1].', 'The relative error is defined as (z−z∗ )/z∗ where z is the approximate solution and z∗ the optimal one.', 'In general, we are interested in finding approximate algorithms whose relative error is bounded from above by a certain constant , i.e., (z − z∗ )/z∗ ≤ (5) Regarding the second issue of time complexity, we are interested in finding fully polynomial approximation algorithms.', 'An approximation algorithm is said to be fully polynomial if for any > 0 it finds a solution satisfying Equation 5 in time polynomially bounded by size of the problem (for the 0-1 knapsack problem, the problem size is equal to the number of items) and by 1/ [1].', 'For the 0-1 knapsack problem, Ibarra and Kim [10] presented a fully polynomial approximation method.', 'It is a parametric method that takes as a parameter and for any > 0, finds a heuristic solution z with relative error at most , such that the time and space complexity grow polynomially with the number of items m and 1/ .', 'More specifically, the space and time complexity are both O(m/ 2 ) and hence polynomial in m and 1/ (see [10] for the detailed approximation algorithm and proof of time and space complexity).', 'Since the Ibarra and Kim method is fully polynomial, we use it to solve our negotiation problem.', 'For 1 ≤ c ≤ m, the approximate equilibrium offer for issue c at time t is denoted as [¯at c,¯bt c] where ¯at c

approximate equilibrium package for the next time period).', 'Using this utility as the capacity of the knapsack, a uses APPROX-TRADEOFFA and obtains the approximate equilibrium package for t = n −

University, Australia linpa@cs.rmit.edu.au ABSTRACT It is well established by conflict theorists and others that successful negotiation should incorporate creating value as well as claiming value.', 'In this paper we propose an approach for maximising joint gains in automated negotiations by formulating the negotiation problem as a multi-criteria decision making problem and taking advantage of several optimisation techniques introduced by operations researchers and conflict theorists.', 'We use a mediator to protect the negotiating parties from unnecessary disclosure of information to their opponent, while also allowing an objective calculation of maximum joint gains.', 'We separate out attributes that take a finite set of values (simple attributes) from those with continuous values, and we show that for simple attributes, the mediator can determine the Pareto-optimal values.', 'INTRODUCTION Given that negotiation is perhaps one of the oldest activities in the history of human communication, it\"s perhaps surprising that conducted experiments on negotiations have shown that negotiators more often than not reach inefficient compromises [1, 21].', 'According to conflict theorists Lax and Sebenius [13], most negotiation actually involves both integrative and distributive bargaining which they refer to as creating value and claiming value.', 'They argue that negotiation necessarily includes both cooperative and competitive elements, and that these elements exist in tension.', 'Negotiators face a dilemma in deciding whether to pursue a cooperative or a competitive strategy at a particular time during a negotiation.', 'This is because a negotiator could use the information about his opponent\"s interests against her during the distributive negotiation process.', 'That is, a negotiator may refuse to concede on an important conflicting issue by claiming that he has made a major concession (on another issue) to meet his opponent\"s interests even though the concession he made could be insignificant to him.', 'Negotiation Support Systems (NSSs) and negotiating software 508 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS agents (NSAs) have been introduced either to assist humans in making decisions or to enable automated negotiation to allow computer processes to engage in meaningful negotiation to reach agreements (see, for instance, [14, 15, 19, 6, 5]).', 'However, because of the Negotiator\"s Dilemma and given even bargaining power and incomplete information, the following two undesirable situations often arise: (i) negotiators reach inefficient compromises, or (ii) negotiators engage in a deadlock situation in which both negotiators refuse to act upon with incomplete information and at the same time do not want to disclose more information.', 'In this paper, we argue for the role of a mediator to resolve the above two issues.', 'The mediator thus plays two roles in a negotiation: (i) to encourage cooperative behaviour among the negotiators, and (ii) to absorb the information disclosure by the negotiators to prevent negotiators from using uncertainty and private information as a strategic device.', 'To take advantage of existing results in negotiation analysis and operations research (OR) literatures [18], we employ multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) theory to allow the negotiation problem to be represented and analysed.', 'Section 2 provides background on MCDM theory and the negotiation framework.', '2.2 A negotiation framework A multi-agent negotiation framework consists of: 1.', 'However, a negotiation infrastructure is usually required to facilitate negotiation.', 'To address this issue, we introduce a mediator to help the agents discover better agreements than the ones they might try to settle on.', 'Note that this problem is essentially the problem of searching for joint gains in a multilateral negotiation in which the involved parties hold strategic information, i.e., the integrative part in a negotiation.', 'Before formalising the decision problems faced by the mediator and the 2 Certainly, without money transfer to compensate agent A, this outcome is not a fair one.', 'In a negotiation setting, the two typical design goals would be: • Efficiency: Avoid the agents from settling on an outcome that is not Pareto-optimal; and • Fairness: Avoid agreements that give the most of the gains to a subset of agents while leaving the rest with too little.', 'The above goals are axiomatised in Nash\"s seminal work [16] on cooperative negotiation games.', 'Essentially, Nash advocates for the following properties to be satisfied by solution to the bilateral negotiation problem: (i) it produces only Pareto-optimal outcomes; (ii) it is invariant to affine transformation (to the consequence space); (iii) it is symmetric; and (iv) it is independent from irrelevant alternatives.', 'It then turns out that, by taking the negotiators\" utilities as its objectives the mediator itself faces a multi-criteria decision making problem.', 'The issues faced by the mediator are: (i) the mediator requires access to the negotiators\" utility functions, and (ii) making (fair) tradeoffs between different agents\" utilities.', 'Our methods allow the agents to repeatedly interact with the mediator so that a Nash solution outcome could be found by the parties.', 'Informally, the problem faced by both the mediator and the negotiators is construction of the indifference curves.', 'The mediator needs to determine how much utility it needs to take away from the other negotiators to give a particular negotiator a specific gain G (in utility).', 'In the second step, we employ an iterative procedure that allows the mediator to interact with the negotiators to find joint improvements that move towards a Pareto-optimal outcome.', 'Most works on multi-attribute, or multi-issue, negotiation (e.g.', 'MEDIATOR-BASED BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS As discussed by Lax and Sebenius [13], under incomplete information the tension between creating and claiming values is the primary cause of inefficient outcomes.', 'As a consequence, the negotiation degenerates to a distributive negotiation, i.e., the negotiating parties should try to claim as much shares from the negotiation issues as possible while the mediator should aim for the fairness of the division.', '4.1 Optimisation on simple attributes In order to extract the optimal values for a subset of attributes, in the first step of this optimisation process the mediator requests the negotiators to submit their respective utility functions over the set of simple attributes.', 'Now, how does the mediator determine the optimal values for the attributes in Simp?', 'If agent 1 misrepresents his utility function to the mediator by reporting utility 0 for all values A, B and C and utility 1 for value D then the agent 2 who plays honestly in his report to the mediator will obtain the worst outcome D given any of the above solutions.', 'As long as he knows that the mediator is going to employ one of the above three solutions, then the above misrepresentation is the dominant strategy for this game.', 'We again appeal to the Assumption 1 on additivity of utility functions to achieve a measure of fairness within this negotiation setting.', 'Given a negotiation framework, if for every agent the set of simple attributes doesn\"t contain a strongly dominant attribute, then truth-telling is an equilibrium strategy for the negotiators during the optimisation of simple attributes.', 'Given a negotiation framework, under the minimax solution, if the negotiators are uncertain about their opponents\" preferences then truth-telling is an equilibrium strategy for the negotiators during the optimisation of simple attributes.', 'The mediator asks the negotiators to discretely submit their respective gradient directions at x, i.e., ∇u1(x) and ∇u2(x).', 'That is, distributive negotiation will then be required to settle the issue.', 'The mediator selects randomly p values mv1, .', 'The mediator then asks the agents to submit their valuations over the set of values {cv1, cv2, mv1, .', '(4) Given the current tentative agreement xh (h ≥ 0), the mediator has to choose a point xh+1 along d = T(xh) so that all parties gain.', 'As 5 Let S be the set of alternatives, x∗ is weakly Pareto optimal if there is no x ∈ S such that ui(x) > ui(x∗ ) for all agents i. the mediator does not know the indifference curves of the parties, he has to use the tangent hyperplanes to the indifference curves of the parties at point x.', 'To start, the mediator asks the negotiators for their gradients ∇u1(xh) and ∇u2(xh), respectively, at xh.', 'If 1 ≥ ∇u1(xh).∇u2(xh) > 0 and the vector T BS (xh) is bounded in Oc then the mediator chooses the compromise improving direction d = T BS (xh) and apply the method described by Ehtamo et al [4] to generate the next tentative agreement xh+1.', 'Otherwise, among the four vectors ISσ i (xh), i = 1, 2 and σ = +/−, the mediator chooses the vector that (i) is bounded in Oc , and (ii) is closest to the gradient of the other agent, ∇uj (xh)(j = i).', 'Note that when xh is an interior point of Oc then the situation is symmetric for the two agents 1 and 2, and the mediator has the choice of either finding a point on IC1(xh) to improve the utility of agent 2, or finding a point on IC2(xh) to improve the utility of agent 1.', 'To decide on which choice to make, the mediator has to compute the distribution of gains throughout the whole process to avoid giving more gains to one agent than to the other.', 'CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we have established a framework for negotiation that is based on MCDM theory for representing the agents\" objectives and utilities.', 'The focus of the paper is on integrative negotiation in which agents aim to maximise joint gains, or create value.', 'on

framework based on automated negotiation.', 'The Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem (DCSP) is one that entails several agents to search for an agreement, which is a consistent combination of actions that satisfies their mutual constraints in a shared environment.', 'INTRODUCTION At the core of many emerging distributed applications is the distributed constraint satisfaction problem (DCSP) - one which involves finding a consistent combination of actions (abstracted as domain values) to satisfy the constraints among multiple agents in a shared environment.', 'Many important algorithms, such as distributed breakout (DBO) [3], asynchronous backtracking (ABT) [4], asynchronous partial overlay (APO) [5] and asynchronous weak-commitment (AWC) [4], have been developed to address the DCSP and provide the agent solution basis for its applications.', 'Broadly speaking, these algorithms are based on two different approaches, either extending from classical backtracking algorithms [6] or introducing mediation among the agents.', 'As a result, for instance, a deeper intellectual understanding on why one algorithm is better than the other, beyond computational issues, is not possible.', 'In this paper, we present a novel, unified distributed constraint satisfaction framework based on automated negotiation [9].', 'The search can be realized via a negotiation mechanism (or algorithm) by which the agents follow a high level protocol prescribing the rules of interactions, using a set of strategies devised to select their own preferences at each negotiation step.', 'Section 3

cl.', 'A constraint may consist of different variables belonging to different agents.', '2.1 DCSP Agent Model In general, all DCSP agents must cooperatively interact, and essentially perform the assignment and reassignment of domain values to variables to resolve all constraint violations.', 'In order to engage in cooperative behavior, a DCSP agent needs five fundamental parameters, namely, (i) a variable [4] or a variable set [10], (ii) domains, (iii) priority, (iv) a neighbor list and (v) a constraint list.', 'An agent which shares the same constraint with another agent is called the latter\"s neighbor.', 'Similarly, each agent maintains a constraint list.', 'Constraints can be added or removed from an agent\"s constraint list in runtime.', 'As with an agent, a constraint can also be associated with a priority value.', 'To distinguish it from the priority of an agent, the priority of a constraint is called its weight.', 'In automated negotiation [9], such a solution is called an agreement among the agents.', 'Within this scope, we found that we were able to unearth the generic behavior of a DCSP agent and formulate it in a negotiation protocol, prescribed using the powerful concepts of BDI.', 'Thus, our proposed negotiation model can be said to combine the BDI concepts with automated negotiation in a multiagent framework, allowing us to conceptually separate DCSP mechanisms into a common BDI interaction protocol and the adopted strategies.', '3.1 The generic protocol Figure 1 shows the basic reasoning steps in an arbitrary round of negotiation that constitute the new protocol.', 'Two types of messages are exchanged through this protocol, namely, the info message and the negotiation message.', 'Info message is sent out at the end of one negotiation round (also called a negotiation cycle), and received at the beginning of next round.', 'A negotiation message is a message which may be sent within a round.', 'This message is for mediation purposes.', 'The format of the negotiation message and when it is to be sent out are subject to the strategy.', 'A negotiation message can be sent out at the end of one reasoning step and received at the beginning of the next step.', 'In synchronous mechanism, mediation is required in every negotiation round.', 'In an asynchronous one, mediation is needed only in a negotiation round when the agent receives a negotiation message.', 'A more in-depth view of this mediation step is provided later in this section.', 'The agent also updates its constraint list C using some criteria of the adopted strategy.', 'Using the image P and constraint list C, the agent will check if there is any violated constraint.', 'In case the agent finds its value in conflict with some of its neighbors\", i.e., the combination of values assigned to the variables leads to a constraint violation, the agent will first try to reassign its own variable using a specific strategy.', 'Once the beliefs are formed, the agent will determine its desires, which are the options that attempt to resolve the current constraint violations.', 'Since, if the agent executes its intention without performing intention mediation with its neighbors, the constraint violation between the agents may not be resolved.', 'Take for example, suppose two agents have variables, x1 and x2, associated with the same domain {1, 2}, and their shared constraint is (x1 + x2 = 3).', 'Then if both the variables are initialized with value 1, they will both concurrently switch between the values 2 and 1 in the absence of mediation between them.', 'There are two types of mediation: local mediation and group mediation.', 'The result of this mediation is passed back to the agents in the group.', 'Following mediation, the agent may proceed to the next reasoning step to execute its intention or begin a new negotiation round.', 'This is the last step of a negotiation round.', '3.2 The strategy A strategy plays an important role in the negotiation process.', 'The design space when devising a strategy is influenced by the following dimensions: (i) asynchronous or synchronous, (ii) dynamic or static priority, (iii) dynamic or static constraint weight, (iv) number of negotiation messages to be communicated, (v) the negotiation message format and (vi) the completeness property.', 'DCSP ALGORITHMS: BDI PROTOCOL + STRATEGIES In this section, we apply the proposed BDI negotiation model presented in Section 3 to expose the BDI protocol and the different strategies used for three well-known algorithms, ABT, AWC and DBO.', 'To describe each strategy formally, the following mathematical notations are used: • n is the number of agents, m is the number of constraints; • xi denotes the variable held by agent i, (0 ≤ i < n); • Di denotes the domain of variable xi; Fi denotes the neighbor list of agent i; Ci denotes its constraint list; • pi denotes the priority of agent i; and Pi =

incorporating the Asynchronous Backtracking (ABT) strategy.', 'As mentioned in Section 3, for an asynchronous mechanism that ABT is, the mediation step is needed only in a negotiation round when an agent receives a negotiation message.', '• If bi = 1, agent i will send a negotiation message to agent k, then remove k from Fi and begin its next negotiation round.', 'The negotiation message will contain the list of variable assignments of those agents in its neighbor list Fi that have a higher priority than agent i in the current image Pi.', 'Mediation: When agent i receives a negotiation message, several sub-steps are carried out, as follows: • If the list of agents associated with the negotiation message contains agents which are not in Fi, it will add these agents to Fi, and request these agents to add itself to their neighbor lists.', 'The request is considered as a type of negotiation message.', 'Following this step, agent i proceeds to the next negotiation round.', '4.2

strategy, the negotiation message will contain the variable assignments (of the current image Pi) for all the agents in Ki.', 'If the same negotiation message had been sent out before, agent i will have nil intention.', '• If bi = 1, it will send the negotiation message to its neighbors in Ki, and set pi = max{pj} + 1, with agent j ∈ Fi.', 'Mediation: This step is identical to the Mediation step

reasons: • UMA can guarantee that there will be a variable reassignment following every negotiation round whereas DBO cannot.', 'Although this increases the communication cost per negotiation round, we observed from our simulations that the overall communication cost incurred by UMA is lower due to the significantly lower number of negotiation rounds.', '• Using UMA, in the worst case, an agent

beta distribution (as per Jøsang and Ismail and Teacy et al.).', 'SINGLE-DIMENSIONAL TRUST Before presenting our multi-dimensional trust model, we first introduce the notation and formalism that we will use by describing the more familiar single dimensional case.', 'Thus, within our trust model oa = 1 now indicates a successful outcome over dimension a of the contract and oa = 0 indicates an unsuccessful one.', 'As before, this estimate is itself represented by an expected value given by: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) and a variance, describing the uncertainty in this expected utility: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) where: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Thus, whilst the single dimensional case naturally leads to a trust model in which the agents attempt to derive an estimate of probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1), along with a scalar variance that describes the uncertainty in this probability, Var(p(o = 1)), in this case, the agents must derive an estimate of a vector of probabilities, ˆp(X), along with a covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), that represents the uncertainty in p(X) given the observed contractual outcomes.', 'In this case, Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), and thus, if the correlation Cab is ignored then the variance in the expected utility is 0.4.', 'Thus, in order to have an accurate estimate of the variance of the expected contract utility, and to make a rational decision, it is essential that the agent is able to represent and calculate these correlation terms.', 'Here we show the values of I and Var(E[U]) calculated by the agents, plotted against the correlation of the contract outcomes, ρ, that constituted their direct experience.', 'However, the value of using our formalism with the full Dirichlet distribution is shown when the correlation between the dimensions increases (either negatively or positively).', 'As can be seen, if we approximate the Dirichlet distribution with multiple independent beta distributions, all of the correlation information contained within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), is lost, and thus, the information content of the matrix is much lower.',

amount of mis-estimation depending on the actual utility function chosen (i.e.', 'Thus, to ensure an accurate estimate, the reputation system must ensure that each observation of a contract outcome is included within the aggregated statistics no more than once.', 'Within a centralised reputation system, where all agents report their direct experience to a trusted center, such double counting of contract outcomes is easy to avoid.', 'However, in a decentralised reputation system, where agents communicate reputation to one another, and aggregate their direct experience with these reputation reports on-the-fly, avoiding double counting is much more difficult.', 'a1 a2 a3 ¨ ¨¨ ¨¨ ¨¨B E T N1 N1 N1 + N2 Figure 3: Example of rumour propagation in a decentralised reputation system.', 'This is

systems.', '6.1 Private and Shared Information Our solution to rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems introduces the notion of private information that an agent knows it has not communicated to any other agent, and shared information that has been communicated to, or received from, another agent.', '• Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).', 'Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agent\"s shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.', 'We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent.', 'The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events.', 'As expected, the centralised reputation system achieves the best estimate of the true distribution, since it uses the direct experience of all agents.', 'The rumour propagation case shows the smallest ellipse, but it is inconsistent with the actual distribution p(X).', 'Thus, propagating rumours around the network and double counting contract outcomes in the belief that they are independent events, results in an overconfident estimate.', 'We note that the rumour propagation case is clearly inconsistent with the centralised reputation system, since its standard deviation is too small and does not reflect the true uncertainty in the expected utility, given the contract outcomes.', 'The exact difference between it and the centralised reputation system depends upon the topology of the network, and the history of exchanges that take place within it.', 'We then showed how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to represent and communicate reputation within a decentralised reputation system, and we presented a solution to rumour propagation within these systems.', 'Agent-based trust model involving multiple qualities.'],

computationally challenging task, particularly when the values of resources are not additive.', 'We consider the combinatorial problem of scheduling the usage of multiple resources among agents that operate in stochastic environments, modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs).', 'In recent years, efficient resource-allocation algorithms have been developed for agents with resource values

tasks of optimal resource allocation and scheduling are ubiquitous in multiagent systems, but solving such optimization problems can be computationally difficult, due to a number of factors.', 'In particular, when the value of a set of resources to an agent is not additive (as is often the case with resources that are substitutes or complements), the utility function might have to be defined on an exponentially large space of resource bundles, which very quickly becomes computationally intractable.', 'Further, even when each agent has a utility function that is nonzero only on a small subset of the possible resource bundles, obtaining optimal allocation is still computationally prohibitive, as the problem becomes NP-complete [14].', 'An alternative is to directly model the mechanisms that define the agents\" utility functions and perform resource allocation directly with these models [9].', 'A way of accomplishing this is to model the processes by which an agent might utilize the resources and define the utility function as the payoff of these processes.', 'In particular, if an agent uses resources to act in a stochastic environment, its utility function can be naturally modeled with a Markov decision process, whose action set is parameterized by the available resources.', 'This representation can then be used to construct very efficient resource-allocation algorithms that lead to an exponential speedup over a straightforward optimization problem with flat representations of combinatorial preferences [6, 7, 8].', 'However, this existing work on resource allocation with preferences induced by resource-parameterized MDPs makes an assumption that the resources are only allocated once and are then utilized by the agents independently within their infinite-horizon MDPs.', 'In this paper, we extend the work on resource allocation under MDP-induced preferences to discrete-time scheduling problems, where agents are present in the system for finite time intervals and can only use resources within these intervals.', 'We address the problem of globally optimal resource scheduling, where the objective is to find an allocation of resources to the agents across time that maximizes the sum of the expected rewards that they obtain.', 'In this context, our main contribution is a mixed-integerprogramming formulation of the scheduling problem that chooses

empirically compare two flavors of the scheduling problem: one, where agents have static resource assignments within their finite-horizon MDPs, and another, where resources can be dynamically reallocated between agents at every time step.', 'In Section 4.2, we describe our main result, the optimization program for globally optimal resource scheduling.', 'However, since the focus of our work is on scheduling problems, and a large part of the optimization problem is to decide how resources are allocated in time among agents with finite arrival and departure times, we model the agents\" planning problems as finite-horizon MDPs, in contrast to previous work that used infinite-horizon discounted MDPs.', 'We also outline the standard methods for combinatorial resource scheduling with flat resource values, which serve as a comparison benchmark for the new model developed here.', 'However, for MDPs with resource constraints (as defined below in Section 3), uniformly-optimal policies do not in general exist.', '2.2 Combinatorial Resource Scheduling A straightforward approach to resource scheduling for a set of agents M, whose values for the resources are induced by stochastic planning problems (in our case, finite-horizon MDPs) would be to have each agent enumerate all possible resource assignments over time and, for each one, compute its value by solving the corresponding MDP.', 'Then, each agent would provide valuations for each possible resource bundle over time to a centralized coordinator, who would compute the optimal resource assignments across time based on these valuations.', 'on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1221 For the scheduling problem where agents have static resource requirements within their finite-horizon MDPs, the agents provide a valuation for each resource bundle for each possible time horizon (from [1, Tm]) that they may use.', 'An agent will get at most one resource bundle for one of the time horizons.', 'Let the variable ψ ∈ Ψm enumerate all possible pairs of resource bundles and time horizons for agent m, so there are 2|Ω| × Tm values for ψ (the space of bundles is exponential in the number of resource types |Ω|).', 'This allocation is expressed as an indicator variable zψ m ∈ {0, 1} that shows whether ψ is assigned to agent m. For time τ and resource ω, the function nm(ψ, τ, ω) ∈ {0, 1} indicates whether the bundle in ψ uses resource ω at time τ (we make the assumption that agents have binary resource requirements).', 'The problem of finding an optimal allocation that satisfies the global constraint that the amount of each resource ω allocated to all agents does not exceed the available amount bϕ(ω) can be expressed as the following integer program: max X m∈M X ψ∈Ψm zψ mvψ m subject to: X ψ∈Ψm zψ m ≤ 1, ∀m ∈ M; X m∈M X ψ∈Ψm zψ mnm(ψ, τ, ω) ≤ bϕ(ω), ∀τ ∈ [1, bτ], ∀ω ∈ Ω; (3) The first constraint in equation 3 says that no agent can receive more than one bundle, and the second constraint ensures that the total assignment of resource ω does not, at any time, exceed the resource bound.', 'For the scheduling problem where the agents are able to dynamically reallocate resources, each agent must specify a value for every combination of bundles and time steps within its time horizon.', 'Let the variable ψ ∈ Ψm in this case enumerate all possible resource bundles for which at most one bundle may be assigned to agent m at each time step.', 'Therefore, in this case there are P t∈[1,Tm](2|Ω| )t ∼ 2|Ω|Tm possibilities of resource bundles assigned to different time slots, for the Tm different time horizons.', 'The same set of equations (3) can be used to solve this dynamic scheduling problem, but the integer program is different because of the difference in how ψ is defined.', 'This straightforward approach to solving both of these scheduling problems requires an enumeration and solution of either 2|Ω| Tm (static allocation) or P t∈[1,Tm] 2|Ω|t  (dynamic reallocation) MDPs for each agent, which very quickly becomes intractable with the growth of the number of resources |Ω| or the time horizon

binary variables: • Δm(τ, ω) = {0, 1}, ∀m ∈ M, τ ∈ [0, bτ], ω ∈ Ω, which serve as indicator variables that define whether agent m possesses resource ω at time τ.', 'The meaning of resource-usage variables Δ is illustrated in Figure 1: Δm(τ, ω) = 1 only if resource ω is allocated to agent m at time τ.', 'After implementing the above constraint, which enforces the meaning of Δ, we add a constraint that ensures that the agents\" resource usage never exceeds the amounts of available resources.', 'Finally, for the problem formulation where resource assignments are static during a lifetime of an agent, we add a constraint that ensures that the resource-usage variables Δ do not change their value while the agent is active (θ = 1).', 'To summarize, Table 1 together with the conservationof-flow constraints from (12) defines the MILP that simultaneously computes an optimal resource assignment for all agents across time as well as optimal finite-horizon MDP policies that

because (a) it is the simplest to implement, (b) fastest to run (the role allocation can be done in constant time without the need of a search through the task structure) and (c) it makes sense from a human-organizational perspective as this heuristic corresponds to dividing an organization along functional lines.', 'Minimizing total resources: This heuristic attempts to minimize the total cost of the resources needed by the agents in the organization to execute their roles.', 'Formally, if R be the local roles of the spawning agent and R be the subset of roles being evaluated for allocation to the newly spawned agent, then the cost function for this heuristic is given by: COST(R, R ) ← |GETEXPECTEDDURATION(R−R )−GETEXPECTEDDURATION(R )| To evaluate these heuristics, we ran a series of experiments that tested the performance of the resultant organization on randomly generated task structures.', 'we want a stable organizational structure that is suited to the task and environmental

spawning than for agent composition and is described below.', 'From this formula, if T is large, p, or the probability of keeping the existing organizational structure is large.', 'Note that the value of p is capped at a certain threshold in order to prevent the organization from being too sluggish in its reaction to environmental change.', 'To compute if agent spawning is necessary, we use the annealing equation with ΔE = 1 α∗Slack where α is a constant and Slack is the difference between the total time available for completion of the outstanding tasks and the sum of the expected time required for completion of each task on the task queue.', 'Also, if the amount of Slack is negative, immediate agent spawning will occur without use of the annealing equation.', 'To calculate if agent composition is necessary, we again use the simulated annealing equation.', 'ORGANIZATION AND ROBUSTNESS There are two approaches commonly used to achieve robustness in multiagent systems: 1. the Survivalist Approach [12], which involves replicating domain agents in order to allow the replicas to take over should the original agents fail; and 2. the Citizen Approach [7], which involves the use of special monitoring agents (called Sentinel Agents) in order to detect agent failure and dynamically startup new agents in lieu of the failed ones.', 'The advantage of the survivalist approach is that recovery is relatively fast, since the replicas are pre-existing in the organization and can take over as soon as a failure is detected.', 'The advantages of the citizen approach are that it requires fewer resources, little modification to the existing organizational structure and coordination protocol and is simpler to implement.', 'Both of these approaches can be applied to achieve robustness in our OSD agents and it is not clear which approach would be better.', 'For example, in order to deduce the organizational knowledge, the monitoring agents need to keep a track of the spawn and compose messages sent by the agents in order to trigger the spawning and composition operations respectively.', 'During the course of the experiment, a series of task instances (problems) arrive at the organization and must be completed by the agents before their specified deadlines.', 'The two graphs in Figure 1, show the average performance of the OSD organization against the Contract Net organizations with 8, 10, 12 and 14 agents.', 'The tested hypothesis are: The OSD organization requires fewer agents to complete an equal or larger number of tasks when compared to the Contract Net organization: To test this hypothesis, we tested the stronger null hypothesis that states that the contract net agents complete more tasks.', 'For large contract net organizations, the number of tasks completed is statistically equivalent to the number completed by the OSD agents, however the number of agents used by the OSD organization is smaller: 9.59 agents (in the static case)

agents in the OSD organization are not wasting time and messages sending bid requests and replying to bids.', 'Also the results of any experiment in which the OSD organization consisted of a single agent ware culled from the results.', 'The response time of a task is defined as the difference between the time at which any agent in the organization starts working on the task (the start time) and the time at which the task was generated (the generation time).', 'This often results in organizations that have an even Figure 2: Graph demonstrating the robustness of the citizen approach.', 'This can be explained by the fact the MR heuristic is extremely greedy and prefers to spawn off small agents that have a tiny resource footprint (so as to minimize the total increase in the resource cost to the organization at the time of spawning).', 'In fact the MR heuristic is not the most effective heuristic when it comes to minimizing the resource-cost of the organization - in fact, it only outperforms a random task/resource allocation.', 'We believe this is in part due to the greedy nature of this heuristic and in part because of the fact that all spawning and composition operations

organizational structure may vary, depending on the probability of failure and the desired level of robustness.', 'For example, one way of achieving a higher level of robustness in the survivalist approach, given a large numbers of agent failures, would be to relax the task deadlines.', 'Therefore, towards this end, we have begun exploring the robustness properties of task structures and the ways in which the organizational design can be modified to take such properties into account.', 'CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a run-time approach to organization in which the agents use

coordination of agents during a hostage rescue mission [11] to the coordination of Autonomous Mars Exploration Rovers [2].', 'OC-DEC-MDP is able to scale up to such domains mainly because instead of searching for the globally optimal solution, it carries out a series of policy iterations; in each iteration it performs a value iteration that reuses the data computed during the previous policy iteration.', 'Second, we prove (both theoretically and empirically) that OC-DEC- MDP overestimates the opportunity cost, and to remedy that, we introduce a set of heuristics, that correct the opportunity cost overestimation problem.', 'Finally, in section 7 we demonstrate empirically the impact of our two orthogonal improvements, i.e., we show that: (i) The new heuristics correct the opportunity cost overestimation problem leading to higher quality policies, and (ii) By allowing for a systematic tradeoff of solution quality for time, the VFP algorithm runs much faster than the OC-DEC-MDP algorithm 2.', 'However, instead of propagating separate values, VFP maintains and propagates the whole functions, we therefore refer to these phases as the value function propagation phase

methods to the source methods.', 'At any time during this phase we encounter a situation shown in Figure 2, where opportunity cost functions [Vjn ]N n=0 of methods [mjn ]N n=0 are known, and the opportunity cost Vi0 of method mi0 is to be derived.', 'Assume for now, that Vjn,i0 represents a full opportunity cost, postponing the discussion on different techniques for splitting the opportunity cost Vj0 into [Vj0,ik ]K k=0 until section 6.', 'Let V j0,i0 (t) be the opportunity cost of starting the execution of method mj0 at time t given that method mi0 has been completed.', 'Therefore the opportunity cost Vj0,i0 (t) of enabling method mi0 at time t must be greater than or equal to V j0,i0 .', 'Knowing the opportunity cost Vi0 , we can then easily derive the value function vi0 .', 'In general, the value function propagation scheme starts with sink nodes.', 'The value function propagation phase terminates when all the source methods have been marked as visited.', '5.3 Probability Function Propagation Phase Assume now, that value functions and opportunity cost values have all been propagated from sink methods to source nodes and the sets Zj for all methods mj ∈ M have been identified.', 'Since value function propagation phase was using probabilities Pi(t) for methods mi ∈ M and times t ∈ [0, Δ] found at previous algorithm iteration, we now have to find new values Pi(t),

enabled by default.', 'The probability function propagation phase terminates when all the sink methods have been marked as visited.', '5.5 Implementation of Function Operations So far, we have derived the functional operations for value function and probability function propagation without choosing any function representation.', 'Since Pi values are in range [0, 1] and Vi values are in range [0, P

opportunity cost Vj0 (t).', 'Since decreasing the upper limit of the integral over positive function also decreases the integral, we have: KX k=0 Vik (t0) > c KX k=0 Z t1 t0 pik (t − t0)Vj0 (t )dt And

the theorem.Figure 4 shows that the overestimation of opportunity cost is easily observable in practice.', 'To remedy the problem of opportunity cost overestimation, we propose three alternative heuristics that split the opportunity cost functions: • Heuristic H 1,0 : Only one method, mik gets the full expected reward for enabling method mj0 , i.e., V j0,ik (t) = 0 for k ∈ {0, ..., K}\\\\{k}

method [mik ]K k=0 initially gets the full opportunity cost for enabling the method mj0 .', 'To avoid opportunity cost overestimation, we normalize the split functions when their sum exceeds the opportunity cost function to be split.', 'When heuristic H 1,0 is used to split the opportunity cost function Vj0 , only one method (e.g.', 'mik ) gets the opportunity cost for enabling method mj0 .', 'For heuristic bH 1,1 , the opportunity cost function Vj0 is by definition split in such manner, that PK k=0 Vik (t) ≤ Vj0 (t).', 'Starvation can be avoided if opportunity cost functions are split using heuristic H 1/2,1/2 , that provides reward to all enabling methods.', 'However, the sum of split opportunity cost functions for the H 1/2,1/2 heuristic can be smaller than the non-zero split opportunity cost function for the H 1,0 heuristic, which is clearly undesirable.', 'EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION Since the VFP algorithm that we introduced provides two orthogonal improvements over the OC-DEC-MDP algorithm, the experimental evaluation we performed consisted of two parts: In part 1, we tested empirically the quality of solutions that an locally optimal solver (either OC-DEC-MDP or VFP) finds, given it uses different opportunity cost function splitting heuristic, and in part 2, we compared the runtimes of the VFP and OC-DEC- MDP algorithms for a variety of mission plan configurations.', 'The first graph confirms, that when the opportunity cost function Vj0 was split into opportunity cost functions Vi1 and Vi2 using the H 1,1 heuristic, the function Vi1 +Vi2 was not always below the Vj0 function.', 'Part 2: We then chose H 1,1 to split the opportunity cost functions and conducted a series of experiments aimed at testing the scalability of VFP for various mission plan configurations, using the performance of the OC-DEC-MDP algorithm as a benchmark.', 'Our heuristic solution method, called Value Function Propagation (VFP), provided two orthogonal improvements of OC-DEC-MDP: (i) It speeded up OC-DECMDP by an order of magnitude by maintaining and manipulating a value function for each method rather than a separate value for each pair of method and time interval, and (ii) it achieved better solution qualities than OC-DEC-MDP because it corrected the overestimation of the opportunity cost of OC-DEC-MDP.'], ['With those results in mind, we discuss the

proliferation of many diverse ontologies caused by different conceptualisations of even the same domain -and their subsequent specification using varying terminology- has highlighted the need of ontology matching techniques that are capable of computing semantic relationships between entities of separately engineered ontologies.', '[5, 11] Until recently, most ontology matching mechanisms developed so far have taken a classical functional approach to the semantic heterogeneity problem, in which ontology matching is seen as a process taking two or more ontologies as input and producing a semantic alignment of ontological entities as output [3].', 'Multi-agent communication, peer-to-peer information sharing, and webservice composition are all of a decentralised, dynamic, and

those ontology fragment that are necessary for the task at hand [10, 13, 9, 8].', 'We claim that semantic alignment of ontological terminology is ultimately relative to the particular situation in which the alignment is carried out, and that this situation should be made explicit and brought into the alignment mechanism.', 'This scenario is reminiscent to those in which a group of distributed agents adapt to form an ontology and a shared lexicon in an emergent, bottom-up manner, with only local interactions and no central control authority [12].', 'In this paper, however, we address the case in which agents are already endowed with a top-down engineered ontology (it can even be the same one), which they do not adapt or refine, but for which they want to find the semantic relationships with separate ontologies of other agents on the grounds of their communication within a specific situation.', 'In particular, we provide a formal model that formalises situated semantic alignment as a sequence of information-channel refinements in the sense of Barwise and Seligman\"s theory of information flow [1].', 'Analogously, the semantic alignment that will allow information to

an architecture in which both consumers and producers use a shared ontology to negotiate a service.', 'We further develop a metric for measuring semantic similarity between services and compare the performance of our approach using different similarity metrics.', 'INTRODUCTION Current approaches to e-commerce treat service price as the primary construct for negotiation by assuming that the service content is fixed [9].', 'However, negotiation on price presupposes that other properties of the service have already been agreed upon.', 'Nevertheless, many times the service provider may not be offering the exact requested service due to lack of resources, constraints in its business policy, and so on [3].', 'When this is the case, the producer and the consumer need to negotiate the content of the requested service [15].', 'However, most existing negotiation approaches assume that all features of a service are equally important and concentrate on the price [5, 2].', 'For instance, completion time of a service may be important for one consumer whereas the quality of the service may be more important for a second consumer.', 'Without doubt, considering the preferences of the consumer has a positive impact on the negotiation process.', 'For this purpose, evaluation of the service components with different weights can be useful.', 'Preference Learning: As an alternative, we propose an architecture in which the service providers learn the relevant features of a service for a particular customer over time.', 'We represent service requests as a vector of service features.', 'We use an ontology in order to capture the relations between services and to construct the features for a given service.', 'The particular service we have used is a wine selling service.', 'Service Generation: Even after the producer learns the important features for a consumer, it needs a method to generate offers that are the most relevant for the consumer among its set of possible services.', 'If the producer has some domain knowledge about semantic similarity (e.g., knows that the red and rose wines are taste-wise more similar than white wine), then it can generate better offers.', 'Section 4 studies the different service offering mechanisms.', 'The consumer agent represents the customer and hence has access to the preferences of the customer.', 'The consumer agent generates requests in accordance with these preferences and negotiates with the producer based on these preferences.', 'A shared ontology provides the necessary vocabulary and hence enables a common language for agents.', 'This ontology describes the content of the service.', 'Further, since an ontology can represent concepts, their properties and their relationships semantically, the agents can reason the details of the service that is being negotiated.', 'Since a service can be anything such as selling a car, reserving a hotel room, and so on, the architecture is independent of the ontology used.', 'However, to make our discussion concrete, we use the well-known Wine ontology [19] with some modification to illustrate our ideas and to test our system.', 'The wine ontology describes different types of wine and includes features such as color, body, winery of the wine and so on.', 'With this ontology, the service that is being negotiated between the consumer and the producer is that of selling wine.', 'The negotiation takes place in a turn-taking fashion, where the consumer agent starts the negotiation with a particular service request.', 'If the producer has the requested wine in its inventory, the producer offers the wine and the negotiation ends.', 'If it is acceptable, then the negotiation will end.', 'This process will continue until some service is accepted by the consumer agent or all possible offers are put forward to the consumer by the producer.', 'One of the crucial challenges of the content-oriented negotiation is the automatic generation of counter offers by the service producer.', 'The requests of the consumers represent individual wine products whereas their preferences are constraints over service features.', 'A well-known incremental decision tree is ID5R [18].', 'During the interactions, each request of the consumer can be considered as a positive example and each counter offer generated by the producer and rejected by the consumer agent can be thought of as a negative example.', 'On the other hand, we need to learn disjunctive concepts in the negotiation of a service since consumer may have several alternative wishes.', 'To be able to learn disjunctive concepts, they create new version spaces by examining the consistency between G and S. We deal with the problem of not supporting disjunctive concepts of CEA by extending our hypothesis language to include disjunctive hypothesis in addition to the conjunctives and negation.', 'Note that compared to the previous studies of disjunctive versions, our approach uses only a single version space rather than multiple version space.', 'Positive means that the service description will possibly be accepted by the consumer agent whereas the negative implies that it will potentially be rejected by the consumer.', 'The decision tree has two types of nodes: leaf node in which the class labels of the instances are held and non-leaf nodes in which test attributes are held.', 'The test attribute in a non-leaf node is one of the attributes making up the service description.', 'When we want to find whether the given service description is acceptable, we start searching from the root node by examining the value of test attributes until reaching a leaf node.', 'To overcome this problem, the system keeps consumer\"s requests throughout the negotiation interaction as positive examples and all counter-offers rejected by the consumer as negative examples.', 'After each coming request, the decision tree is rebuilt.', '4.1 Service Offering via CEA and DCEA To generate the best offer, the producer agent uses its service ontology and the CEA algorithm.', 'The service offering mechanism is the same for both the original CEA and DCEA, but as explained before their methods for updating G and S are different.', 'When producer receives a request from the consumer, the learning set of the producer is trained with this request as a positive sample.', 'In other words, it filters the service set from the undesired services, since G contains hypotheses that are consistent with the requests of the consumer.', 'Since the most specific set S holds the previous requests and the current request, estimating similarity between this set and every service in the service list is very convenient to find the best offer from the service list.', 'When the consumer starts the interaction with the producer agent, producer agent loads all related services to the service list object.', 'When the producer cannot offer the service as requested, it tries to find the service that is most similar to the services that have been requested by the consumer during the negotiation.', 'After the similarity of the available services with the current S is calculated, there may be more than one service with the maximum similarity.', 'Here, we have associated a rating value with each service and the producer prefers the higher rated service to others.', 'First, since ID3 does not maintain G, the list of unaccepted services that are classified as negative are removed from the service list.', '4.3 Alternative Service Offering Mechanisms In addition to these three service offering mechanisms (Service Offering with CEA, Service Offering with DCEA, and Service Offering with ID3), we include two other mechanisms.. 1304 The Sixth Intl.', 'on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) • Random Service Offering (RO): The producer generates a counter offer randomly from the available service list, without considering the consumer\"s preferences.', 'The similarity metric affects the performance of the system while deciding which service is the closest to the consumer\"s request.', 'We first analyze some existing metrics and then propose a new semantic similarity metric named RP Similarity.', '5.1 Tversky\"s Similarity Metric Tversky\"s similarity metric compares two vectors in terms of the number of exactly matching features [17].', 'Tversky\"s similarity metric is designed to compare two feature vectors.', 'Take service s as (Light, Strong, Rose).', 'We compute the similarity of each hypothesis with the given service and weight them with the number of samples they cover.', 'We find the similarity by dividing the weighted sum of the similarities of all hypotheses in S with the service by the number of all samples that are covered in S.

interoperability among different agent reputation models.', 'This paper describes how the FORe can be applied to allow interoperability among agents that have different reputation models.', 'An outline of this approach is sketched in the context of a testbed for the experimentation and comparison of trust models, the ART testbed [6].', 'THE FUNCTIONAL ONTOLOGY OF REPUTATION (FORe) In the last years several computational models of reputation have been proposed [7][10][13][14].', 'As an example of research produced in the MAS field we refer to three of them: a cognitive reputation model [5], a typology of reputation [7] and the reputation model used in the ReGret system [9][10].', 'For instance, Image and Reputation are two central concepts in the cognitive reputation model.', 'These concepts do not exist in the typology of reputation or in the ReGret model.', 'In the typology of reputation, we can find some similar concepts such as direct reputation and indirect reputation but there are some slight semantic differences.', 'In the same way, the ReGret model includes four kinds of reputation (direct, witness, neighborhood and system) that overlap with the concepts of other models but that are not exactly the same.', 'The Functional Ontology of Reputation (FORe) was defined as a common semantic basis that subsumes the concepts of the main reputation models.', 'The FORe includes, as its kernel, the following concepts: reputation nature, roles involved in reputation formation and propagation, information sources for reputation, evaluation of reputation, and reputation maintenance.', 'The ontology concept ReputationNature is composed of concepts such as IndividualReputation, GroupReputation and ProductReputation.', 'The ontology defines the concepts ReputationProcess and ReputationRole.', 'Moreover, reputation can be classified according to the origin of beliefs and opinions that can derive from several sources.', 'The ontology defines the concept ReputationType which can be PrimaryReputation or SecondaryReputation.', 'MAPPING THE AGENT REPUTATION MODELS TO THE FORe Visser et al [12] suggest three different ways to support semantic integration of different sources of information: a centralized approach, where each source of information is related to one common domain ontology; a decentralized approach, where every source of information is related to its own ontology; and a hybrid approach, where every source of information has its own ontology and the vocabulary of these ontologies are related to a common ontology.', 'Casare and Sichman [3] used the hybrid approach to show that the FORe serves as a common ontology for several reputation models.', 'Therefore, considering the ontologies which describe the agent reputation models we can define a mapping between these ontologies and the FORe whenever the ontologies use a common vocabulary.', 'Also, the information concerning the mappings between the agent reputation models and the FORe can be directly inferred by simply classifying the resulting ontology from the integration of a given reputation model ontology and the FORe in an ontology tool with reasoning engine.', 'For instance, a mapping between the Cognitive Reputation Model ontology and the FORe relates the concepts Image and Reputation to PrimaryReputation and SecondaryReputation from FORe, respectively.', 'EXPERIMENTAL SCENARIOS USING THE ART TESTBED To exemplify the use of mappings from last section, we define a scenario where several agents are implemented using different agent reputation models.', 'This scenario includes the agents\" interaction during the simulation of the game defined by ART [6] in order to describe the ways interoperability is possible between different trust models using the FORe.', '4.1 The ART testbed The ART testbed provides a simulation engine on which several agents, using different trust models, may run.', 'The simulation consists in a game where the agents have to decide to trust or not other agents.', 'The information can be an opinion transaction, when an agent asks other agents to help it in its evaluation of a painting; or a reputation transaction, when the information required is about the reputation of another agent (a target) for a given era.', 'The ART common reputation model was enhanced with semantic data obtained from FORe.', 'A general agent architecture for interoperability was defined [11] to allow agents to reason about the information received from reputation interactions.', 'This architecture contains two main modules: the Reputation Mapping Module (RMM) which is responsible for mapping concepts between an agent reputation model and FORe; and the Reputation Reasoning Module (RRM) which is responsible for deal with information about reputation according to the agent reputation model.', '4.2 Reputation transaction scenarios While including the FORe to the ART common reputation model, we have incremented it to allow richer interactions that involve reputation transaction.', 'In this section we describe scenarios concerning reputation transactions in the context of ART testbed, but the first is valid for any kind of reputation transaction and the second is specific for the ART domain.', '4.2.1 General scenario Suppose that agents A, B and C are implemented according to the aforementioned general agent architecture with the enhanced ART common reputation model, using different reputation models.', 'Consider the interaction about reputation where agents A and B receive from agent C information about the reputation of agent Y.', 'Interaction about reputation The information witness reputation from agent C is treated by its RMM and is sent as PropagatedReputation to both agents.', 'The corresponding information in agent A reputation model is propagated reputation and in agent B reputation model is reputation.', 'The way agents A and B make use of the information

agent A is processed in its RRM and it is composed of tuples (agent, value, cubism, image) , where the pair (agent, value) is composed of all agents and associated reputation values whose agent B

Department Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA, USA gilpin@cs.cmu.edu Tuomas Sandholm Computer Science Department Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA, USA sandholm@cs.cmu.edu ABSTRACT Finding an equilibrium of an extensive form game of imperfect information is a fundamental problem in computational game theory, but current techniques do not scale to large games.', 'To address this, we introduce the ordered game isomorphism and the related ordered game isomorphic abstraction transformation.', 'For a multi-player sequential game of imperfect information with observable actions and an ordered signal space, we prove that any Nash equilibrium in an abstracted smaller game, obtained by one or more applications of the transformation, can be easily converted into a Nash equilibrium in the original game.', 'Using GameShrink, we find an equilibrium to a poker game with 3.1 billion nodes-over four orders of magnitude more than in the largest poker game solved previously.', 'Game theory provides a normative framework for analyzing such strategic situations.', 'In particular, it provides solution concepts that define what rational behavior is in such settings.', 'The most famous and important solution concept is that of Nash equilibrium [36].', 'It is a strategy profile (one strategy for each agent) in which no agent has incentive to deviate to a different strategy.', 'Games can be classified as either games of perfect information or imperfect information.', 'Minimax search runs in linear time in the size of the game tree.2 The differentiating feature of games of imperfect information, such as poker, is that they are not fully observable: when it is an agent\"s turn to move, she does not have access to all of the information about the world.', 'Thus the algorithms for perfect information games do not solve games of imperfect information.', 'For sequential games with imperfect information, one could try to find an equilibrium using the normal (matrix) form, where every contingency plan of the agent is a pure strategy for the agent.3 Unfortunately (even if equivalent strategies 1 This actually yields a solution that satisfies not only the Nash equilibrium solution concept, but a stronger solution concept called subgame perfect Nash equilibrium [45].', '1.1 Our approach In this paper, we take a different approach to tackling the difficult problem of equilibrium computation.', 'Instead of developing an equilibrium-finding method per se, we instead develop a methodology for automatically abstracting games in such a way that any equilibrium in the smaller (abstracted) game corresponds directly to an equilibrium in the original game.', 'Thus, by computing an equilibrium in the smaller game (using any available equilibrium-finding algorithm), we are able to construct an equilibrium in the original game.', 'The motivation is that an equilibrium for the smaller game can be computed drastically faster than for the original game.', 'By operating only in the space of filters, we are able to keep the strategic structure of the game intact, while abstracting out details of the game in a way that is lossless from the perspective of equilibrium finding.', 'We introduce the ordered game isomorphism to describe strategically symmetric situations and the ordered game isomorphic abstraction transformation to take advantange of such symmetries (Section 3).', 'As our main equilibrium result we have the following: constant number of agents can be constructed in quasipolynomial time [31], but finding an exact equilibrium is PPAD-complete even in a 2-player game [8].', 'The most prevalent algorithm for finding an equilibrium in a 2-agent game is Lemke-Howson [30], but it takes exponentially many steps in the worst case [44].', 'For a survey of equilibrium computation in 2-player games, see [53].', '4 There were also early techniques that capitalized in different ways on the fact that in many games the vast majority of pure strategies are not played in equilibrium [54, 23].', 'Let F be an information filter constructed from F by one application of the ordered game isomorphic abstraction transformation, and let σ be a Nash equilibrium strategy profile of the induced game ΓF (i.e., the game Γ using the filter F ).', 'If σ is constructed by using the corresponding strategies of σ , then σ is a Nash equilibrium of ΓF .', 'The proof of the theorem uses an equivalent characterization of Nash equilibria: σ is a Nash equilibrium if and only if there exist beliefs μ (players\" beliefs about unknown information) at all points of the game reachable by σ such that σ is sequentially rational (i.e., a best response) given μ, where μ is updated using Bayes\" rule.', 'We can then use the fact that σ is a Nash equilibrium to show that σ is a Nash equilibrium considering only local properties of the game.', '1.2 Electronic commerce applications Sequential games of imperfect information are ubiquitous, for example in negotiation and in auctions.', 'We chose a particular poker game as the benchmark problem because it yields an extremely complicated and enormous game tree, it is a game of imperfect information, it is fully specified as a game (and the data is available), and it has been posted as a challenge problem by others [47] (to our knowledge no such challenge problem instances have been proposed for electronic commerce applications that require solving sequential games).', 'Almost since the field\"s founding, game theory has been used to analyze different aspects

moves in the game.', 'Associated with every ordered game Γ = I, G, L, Θ, κ, γ, p, , ω, u and information filter F is a filtered signal tree, a directed tree in which each node corresponds to some revealed (filtered) signals and edges correspond to revealing specific (filtered) signals.', 'The nodes in the filtered signal tree represent the set of all possible revealed filtered signals (public

Since σ is a Nash equilibrium of Γ , there exists such a belief system μ for ΓF .', '3.1 Nontriviality of generalizing beyond this model Our model does not capture general sequential games of imperfect information because it is restricted in two ways (as discussed above): 1) there is a special structure connecting the player actions and the chance actions (for one, the players are assumed to observe each others\" actions, but nature\"s actions might not be publicly observable), and 2) there is a common ordering of signals.', 'In this game, player 1\"s only Nash equilibrium strategy is

run in sublinear time and space in the size of the game tree because the signal tree is significantly smaller than the game tree in most nontrivial games, as discussed above.', 'This will be most useful when we want to evaluate how well a given strategy performs when we know that it is not an equilibrium strategy.', '5.1 State-space approximations By slightly modifying GameShrink, we can obtain an algorithm that yields even smaller game trees, at the expense of losing the equilibrium guarantees of Theorem 2.', '5.2 Algorithmic approximations In the case of two-player zero-sum games,

Juda Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences Harvard University, Harvard Business School ajuda@hbs.edu David C. Parkes Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences Harvard University parkes@eecs.harvard.edu ABSTRACT Bidders on eBay have no dominant bidding strategy when faced with multiple auctions each offering an item of interest.', 'These misqueues in strategic behavior hamper the efficiency of the system, and in so doing limit the revenue potential for sellers.', 'This paper proposes a novel options-based extension to eBay\"s proxy-bidding system that resolves this strategic issue for buyers in commoditized markets.', 'An empirical analysis of eBay provides a basis for computer simulations that investigate the market effects of the options-based scheme, and demonstrates that the options-based scheme provides greater efficiency than eBay, while also increasing seller revenue.', 'One of the most common examples today of an electronic marketplace is eBay, where the gross merchandise volume (i.e., the sum of all successfully closed listings) during 2005 was $44B.', 'Why might the sequential auction problem be bad?', 'A seller sells an option for a good, which will ultimately lead to either a sale of the good or the return of the option.', 'The proxy agents use this information to determine how much to bid for options, and follow a dominant bidding strategy across all relevant auctions.', 'We conduct an empirical analysis of eBay, collecting data on over four months of bids for Dell LCD screens (model E193FP) starting in the Summer of 2005.', 'We also extend the work of Haile and Tamer [11] to estimate an upper bound on the distribution of value of eBay bidders, taking into account the sequential auction problem when making the adjustments.', 'Among the 508 bidders that won exactly one monitor and participated in multiple auctions, 201 (40%) paid more than $10 more than the closing price of another auction in which they bid, paying on average $35 more (standard deviation $21) than the closing price of the cheapest auction in which they bid but did not win.', 'Furthermore, among the 2,216 bidders that never won an item despite participating in multiple auctions, 421 (19%) placed a losing bid in one auction that was more than $10 higher than the closing price of another auction in which they bid, submitting a losing bid on average $34 more (standard deviation $23) than the closing price of the cheapest auction in which they bid but did not win.', 'Consider the following example to see that LSP is insufficient for the existence of a dominant bidding strategy for buyers facing a sequence of auctions.', 'Alice has no dominant bidding strategy because she needs to know the price for Stone on Tuesday to know her maximum willingness to pay for Sand on Monday.', 'Given locally strategyproof single-item auctions, the sequential auction problem exists for a bidder if and only if either of the following two conditions is true: (1) within the set of interesting bundles (a) there are two bundles that are substitutes, (b) there is an item with uncertain marginal value, or (c) there is an item that is over-supplied; (2) a bidder faces competitors\" bids that are conditioned on the bidder\"s past bids.', 'For example, the following buyers all face the sequential auction problem as a result of condition (a), (b) and (c) respectively: a buyer who values one ton of Sand for $1,000, or one ton of Stone for $2,000, but not both Sand and Stone; a buyer who values one ton of Sand for $1,000, one ton of Stone for $300, and one ton of Sand and one ton of Stone for $1,500, and can participate in an auction for Sand before an auction for Stone; a buyer who values one ton of Sand for $1,000 and can participate in many auctions selling Sand.', 'SUPER PROXIES AND OPTIONS The novel solution proposed in this work to resolve the sequential auction problem consists of two primary components: richer proxy agents, and options with price matching.', 'In finance, a real option is a right to acquire a real good at a certain price, called the exercise price.', 'An option provides the right to purchase a good at an exercise price but not the obligation.', 'Options are typically sold at a price called the option price.', 'However, options obtained at a non-zero option price cannot generally support a simple, dominant bidding strategy, as a buyer must compute the expected value of an option to justify the cost [8].', 'Instead, we consider costless options with an option price of zero.', 'This will require some care as buyers are weakly better off with a costless option than without one, whatever its exercise price.', 'Each auction is modified to sell an option on that good to the highest bidding proxy, with an initial exercise price set to the second-highest bid received.12 When an option in which a buyer is interested becomes available for the first time, the proxy determines its bid by computing the buyer\"s maximum marginal value for the item, and then submits a bid in this amount.', 'XY  implies an option with exercise price X and bookkeeping that a proxy has prevented Y from currently possessing an option.', 'When a proxy wins an auction for an option, the proxy will store in its local memory the identity (which may be a pseudonym) of the proxy not holding an option because of the proxy\"s win (i.e., the proxy that it ‘bumped\" from winning, if any).', '4.1.2 Pricing Options Sellers agree by joining the market to allow the proxy representing a buyer to adjust the exercise price of an option that it holds downwards if the proxy discovers that it could have achieved a better price by waiting to bid in a later auction for an option on the same good.', 'To assist in the implementation of the price matching scheme each proxy tracks future auctions for an option that it has already won and will determine who would be bidding in that auction had the proxy delayed its entry into the market until this later auction.', 'The proxy will request price matching from the seller that granted it an option if the proxy discovers that it could have secured a lower price by waiting.', 'To reiterate, the proxy does not acquire more than one option for any good.', 'Rather, it reduces the exercise price on its already issued option if a better deal is found.', 'If this high bid is lower than the current option price held, the proxy price matches down to this high bid price.', 'Molly\"s proxy wins the Monday auction, submitting a bid of $8 and receiving an option for $6.', 'On Tuesday, only Nancy\"s and Polly\"s proxy bid (as Molly\"s proxy holds an option), with Nancy\"s proxy winning an opBuyer Type Monday Tuesday Truth: Molly (Mon, Mon, $8) 6NancyNancy (Mon, Tues, $6) - 4Polly Polly (Mon, Tues, $4) -Misreport: Molly (Mon, Mon, $8) -Nancy (Mon, Tues, $10)

lead to a truthful system whereas simply matching to the lowest winning price will not.', 'At this time, Molly\"s proxy will price match its option down to $4 and replace Nancy with Polly in its local memory as per the price match algorithm, as Polly would be holding an option had Molly never bid.', 'Therefore, a seller of an option must wait until period ˆdw for the option to be exercised and receive payment, where w was the winner of the option.13 For bidder i, in period ˆdi, the proxy chooses the option(s) that maximize the (reported) utility of the buyer: θ∗ t = argmax θ⊆Θ (ˆvi(γ(θ)) − π(θ)) (2) where Θ is the set of all options held, γ(θ) are the goods corresponding to a set of options, and π(θ) is the sum of exercise prices for a set of options.', '14 Presumably, an option returned will result in the seller holding a new auction for an option on the item it still possesses.', 'However, the system will not allow a seller to re-auction an option until ΔMax after the option had first been issued in order to maintain a truthful mechanism.', '184 would win the Monday auction and receive an option with an exercise price of $6 (subsequently exercising that option at the end of Monday), and Nancy would win the Tuesday auction and receive an option with an exercise price of $4 (subsequently exercising that option at the end of Tuesday).', 'Nancy would win the Monday auction and receive an option with an exercise price of $8.', 'On Tuesday, Polly would win the auction and receive an option with an exercise price of $0.', 'Nancy\"s proxy would observe that the highest bid submitted on Tuesday among those proxies not stored in local memory is Polly\"s bid of $4, and so Nancy\"s proxy would price match the exercise price of its option down to $4.', 'The third scenario in Table 2 demonstrates the outcome if Nancy were to misreport her value for the good by reporting an inflated value of $10, if the price matching scheme were for proxies to simply match their option price to the lowest winning price at any time while they are in the system.', 'Nancy would win the Monday auction and receive an option with an exercise price of $8.', 'On Tuesday, Polly would win the auction and receive an option with an exercise price of $0.', 'Nancy\"s proxy would observe that the lowest price on Tuesday was $0, and so Nancy\"s proxy would price match the exercise price of its option down to $0.', 'By construction of the algorithm, the proxy stores one maximum marginal value for each item for bidding, of which there are O(K); at most one buyer\"s identity for each item, of which there are O(K); and one current option exercise price for each item, of which there are O(K).', 'At any given time, there is at most one buyer in the system whose proxy does not hold an option for a given item type because of buyer i\"s presence in the system, and the identity of that buyer will be stored in i\"s proxy\"s local memory at that time if such a buyer exists.', 'If (a), the buyer\"s presence prevented exactly that one buyer from winning an option, but will have not prevented any other proxies from winning an option (as the buyer\"s proxy will not bid on additional options upon securing one), and will have had that bumped proxy\"s identity in its local memory by definition of the algorithm.', 'If (b), the buyer has not prevented the bumped proxy from winning an option after all, but rather has prevented only the proxy that lost to the bumped proxy from winning (if any), whose identity will now be stored in the proxy\"s local memory by definition of the algorithm.', 'First, define a simple agent-independent price function pk i (t, v−i) as the highest bid by the proxies not holding an option on an item of type Gk at time t, not including the proxy representing i herself and not including any proxies that would have already won an option had i never entered the system (i.e., whose identity is stored in i\"s proxy\"s local memory)(∞ if no supply at t).', 'By construction of price matching, this is exactly the price obtained by a proxy on any option that it holds at departure.', 'For each such bundle, either there is an item priced at ∞ (in which case the bundle would not be desired) or there must be an item in that bundle for which the proxy does not hold an option that was available.', 'For sellers, the price of each option is based on a non-negative bid or zero.', 'We simulate a sequence of auctions that match the timing of the Dell LCD auctions on eBay.16 When an auction successfully closes on eBay, we simulate a Vickrey auction for an option on the item sold in that period.', '17 For the 100 bidders that won multiple times on eBay, we have each one bid a constant marginal value for each additional item in each auction until the number of options held equals the total number of LCDs won on eBay, with each option available for price matching independently.', 'This bidding strategy is not a dominant strategy (falling outside the type space possible for buyers on which the proof of truthfulness has been built), but is believed to be the most appropriate first order action for simulation.', 'To fix this, we would prefer to have proxy agents use more caution in acquiring options and use a more adaptive bidding strategy than that in Equation 1.', 'For instance, if a proxy is already holding an option with an exercise price of $3 on some item for which it has value of $10, and it values some substitute item at $5, the proxy could reason that in no circumstance will it be useful to acquire an option on the second item.', 'We formulate a more sophisticated bidding strategy along these lines.', 'Let the maximal willingness to pay for an item k represent a price above which the agent knows it would never exercise an option on the item given the current options held.', 'Alice\"s proxy wins an option to purchase Sand for $1,500.', 'On day two, a Stone auction is held, where Alice\"s proxy bids $1,500 [as she has already obtained a guaranteed $500 of surplus from winning a Sand option, and so reduces her Stone bid by this amount], and Bob\"s bids $1,500.', 'At the end of the second day, Alice\"s proxy holds an option with an exercise price of $1,500 to obtain a good valued for $2,000, and so obtains $500 in surplus.', 'Bob\"s proxy wins an option to purchase Sand for $0.', 'On day two, a Stone auction is held, where Alice\"s proxy bids $2,000, and Bob\"s bids $0 [as he has already obtained a guaranteed $1,500 of surplus from winning a Sand

natural extension of classical evolutionary game theory (EGT) to a setting in which pairwise interactions are restricted to the edges of an undirected graph or network.', 'The classical setting can be viewed as the special case in which the underlying network is a clique.', 'More generally, as evolutionary game theory has become a plausible model not only for biological interaction, but also economic and other kinds of interaction in which certain dynamics are more imitative than optimizing (see [2, 16] and chapter 4 of [19]), the network constraints may come from similarly more general sources.', 'Evolutionary game theory on networks has been considered before, but not in the generality we will do so here (see Section 4).', 'We generalize the definition of an evolutionary stable

the line of graph-theoretic models for game theory investigated in both computer science [13] and economics [10].', 'CLASSICAL EGT The fundamental concept of evolutionary game theory is the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS).', 'The standard model of evolutionary game theory considers an infinite population of organisms, each of which plays a strategy in a fixed, 2-player, symmetric game.', 'In this paper our interest is to examine what kinds of network structure preserve the ESS strategies for those games that do have a standard ESS.', 'First we must of course generalize the definition of ESS to a network setting.', 'Instead, we assume that organisms interact only with those in their local neighborhood, as defined by an undirected graph or network.', 'As in the classical setting (which can be viewed as the special case of the complete network or clique), we shall assume an infinite population, by which we mean we examine limiting behavior in a family of graphs of increasing size.', 'In the classical (complete graph) setting, there exist many symmetries that may be broken in moving to the the network setting, at both the group and individual level.', 'In the network setting, this may not be true: some mutant sets may be better able to survive than others due to the specific topologies of their interactions in the network.', 'In the network setting, individual fates may differ within a group all playing a common strategy.', 'Classical evolutionary game theory examines an infinite, symmetric population.', 'Thus a common theme of these results is the power of randomization: as long as either the network itself is chosen randomly, or the mutation set is chosen randomly, classical ESS are preserved.', 'NETWORKS PRESERVING ESS We now proceed to

persons up to that point.', 'As the number of exchanged recommendations increases, the probability of buying starts to decrease to about half of the original value and then levels off.', 'The two interesting questions are: how does the probability of getting a 10% credit change with the number of outgoing recommendations; and given a number of outgoing recommendations, how many purchases will they influence?', 'But if we plot the probability of getting a 10% credit as a function of the number of outgoing recommendations, as in the bottom row of figure 7, we see that the success of DVD recommendations saturates as well, while books, videos and music have qualitatively similar trends.', 'The difference in the curves for DVD recommendations points to the presence of collisions in the dense DVD network, which has 10 recommendations per node and around 400 per product - an order of magnitude more than other product groups.', 'TIMING OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND PURCHASES The recommendation referral program encourages people to purchase as soon as possible after they get a recommendation, since this maximizes the probability of getting a discount.', 'We study the time lag

'They have relatively many recommendations with a small number of senders and receivers, which suggests a very dense recommendation network where lots of recommendations were exchanged between a small community of people.', 'Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling.', 'Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that individuals have equal probability of being infected every time they interact.', 'Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction.', 'Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of ‘converting\" every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.', 'Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.', 'But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.', 'We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.', 'We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.', 'So despite the relative ineffectiveness of the viral marketing program in general, we found a number of new insights which we hope will have general applicability to marketing strategies and to future models of viral information spread.', 'Consumer surplus in the digital economy: Estimating the value of increased product variety at online booksellers.', 'As consumer attitudes shift, so must marketing strategies.'], ['The quality of this aggregation process crucially affects the user experience and hence the effectiveness of recommenders in e-commerce.', 'We present a novel study that disaggregates global recommender performance metrics into contributions made by each individual rating, allowing us to characterize the many roles played by ratings in nearestneighbor collaborative filtering.', 'For instance, they can be used to track the evolution of neighborhoods, to identify rating subspaces that do not contribute (or contribute negatively) to system performance, to enumerate users who are in danger of leaving, and to assess the susceptibility of the system to attacks such as shilling.', 'We argue that the three rating roles presented here provide broad primitives to manage a recommender system and its community.', 'INTRODUCTION Recommender systems have become integral to e-commerce, providing technology that suggests products to a visitor based on previous purchases or rating history.', 'Collaborative filtering, a common form of recommendation, predicts a user\"s rating for an item by combining (other) ratings of that user with other users\" ratings.', 'However, with the exception of a few studies on the influence of users [10], little attention has been paid to unraveling the inner workings of a recommender in terms of the individual ratings and the roles they play in making (good) recommendations.', 'Such an understanding will give an important handle to monitoring and managing a recommender system, to engineer mechanisms to sustain the recommender, and thereby ensure its continued success.', 'Our motivation here is to disaggregate global recommender performance metrics into contributions made by each individual rating, allowing us to characterize the many roles played by ratings in nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering.', 'Viewing ratings in this way, we can define the contribution of a rating in each role, both in terms of allowing recommendations to occur, and in terms of influence on the quality of recommendations.', 'Situating users in better neighborhoods: A user\"s ratings may inadvertently connect the user to a neighborhood for which the user\"s tastes may not be a perfect match.', 'Identifying users who can be encouraged to rate specific items helps ensure coverage of the recommender system.', 'Monitoring the evolution of the recommender system and its stakeholders: A recommender system is constantly under change: growing with new users and 250 items, shrinking with users leaving the system, items becoming irrelevant, and parts of the system under attack.', 'Tracking the roles of a rating and its evolution over time provides many insights into the health of the system, and how it could be managed and improved.', 'These include being able to identify rating subspaces that do not contribute (or contribute negatively) to system performance, and could be removed; to enumerate users who are in danger of leaving, or have left the system; and to assess the susceptibility of the system to attacks such as shilling [5].', 'As we show, the characterization of rating roles presented here provides broad primitives to manage a recommender system and its community.', 'Section 3 defines and discusses the roles of a rating, and Section 4 defines measures of the contribution of a rating in each of these roles.', '[11] defines the similarity of two users u and v as the Pearson correlation of their common ratings: sim(u, v) = P i∈Iu∩Iv (ru,i − ¯ru)(rv,i − ¯rv) qP i∈Iu (ru,i − ¯ru)2 qP i∈Iv (rv,i − ¯rv)2 , where Iu is the set of items rated by user u, ru,i is user u\"s rating for item i, and ¯ru is the average rating of user u (similarly for v).', 'These new similarities are then used to define a static neighborhood Nu for each user u consisting of the top K users most similar to user u.', '(3) Given the similarities, the neighborhood Ni of an item i is defined as the top K most similar items for that item.', 'Studies on recommender algorithms, notably Herlocker et al.', 'ROLES OF A RATING Our basic observation is that each rating plays a different role in each prediction in which it is used.', 'Consider a simplified movie recommender system with three users Jim, Jeff, and Tom and their ratings for a few movies, as shown in Fig.', '(For this initial discussion we will not consider the rating values involved.)', 'The recommender predicts whether Tom will like The Mask using the other already available ratings.', 'An item-based collaborative filtering algorithm constructs a neighborhood of movies around The Mask by using the ratings of users who rated The Mask and other movies similarly (e.g., Jim\"s ratings of The Matrix and The Mask; and Jeff\"s ratings of Star Wars and The Mask).', 'A user-based collaborative filtering algorithm would construct a neighborhood around Tom by tracking other users whose rating behaviors are similar to Tom\"s (e.g., Tom and Jeff have rated Star Wars; Tom and Jim have rated The Matrix).', 'The prediction of Tom\"s rating for The Mask is then based on the ratings of Jeff and Tim.', 'So, irrespective of the collaborative filtering algorithm used, we can visualize the prediction of Tom\"s rating of The Mask as walking through a sequence of ratings.', 'Jim Tom Jeff The Matrix Star Wars The Mask q1 q2 q3 p1 p2 p3 Jerry r2 r3 Figure 3: Prediction of The Mask for Tom in which a rating is used more than once.', 'A rating can be part of many paths for a single prediction as shown in Fig.', 'The rating p1 (Tom → Star Wars) makes a connection from Tom to other ratings that can be used to predict Tom\"s rating for The Mask.', 'This rating serves as a scout in the bipartite graph of ratings to find a path that leads to The Mask.', 'The rating p2 (Jeff → Star Wars) helps the system recommend The Mask to Tom by connecting the scout to the promoter.', 'The rating p3 (Jeff → The Mask) allows connections to The Mask, and, therefore, promotes this movie to Tom.', 'Formally, given a prediction pu,a of a target item a for user u, a scout for pu,a is a rating ru,i such that there exists a user v with ratings rv,a and rv,i for some item i; a promoter for pu,a is a rating rv,a for some user v, such that there exist ratings rv,i and ru,i for an item i, and; a connector for pu,a 252 Jim Tom Jeff Jerry My Cousin Vinny The Matrix Star Wars The Mask Jurasic Park Figure 4: Scouts, promoters, and connectors.', 'is a rating rv,i by some user v and rating i, such that there exists ratings ru,i and rv,a.', 'The scouts, connectors, and promoters for the prediction of Tom\"s rating of The Mask are p1 and q1, p2 and q2, and p3 and q3 (respectively).', 'Each of these roles has a value in the recommender to the user, the user\"s neighborhood, and the system in terms of allowing recommendations to be made.', '3.1 Roles in Detail Ratings that act as scouts tend to help the recommender system suggest more movies to the user, though the extent to which this is true depends on the rating behavior of other users.', '4 the rating Tom → Star Wars helps the system recommend only The Mask to him, while Tom → The Matrix helps recommend The Mask, Jurassic Park, and My Cousin Vinny.', 'Tom makes a connection to Jim who is a prolific user of the system, by rating The Matrix.', 'His rating of The Mask is the best scout for Jeff, and Jerry\"s only scout is his rating of Star Wars.', 'On the other hand, Jerry\"s rating of Star Wars does not help promote it to any other user.', 'We conclude that a good promoter connects an item to a broader neighborhood of other items, and thereby ensures that it is recommended to more users.', 'Connectors serve a crucial role in a recommender system that is not as obvious.', 'A connector improves the system\"s ability to make recommendations with no explicit gain for the user.', 'Note that every rating can be of varied benefit in each of these roles.', 'The rating Jim → My Cousin Vinny is a poor scout and connector, but is a very good promoter.', 'The rating Jim → The Mask is a reasonably good scout, a very good connector, and a good promoter.', 'Finally, the rating Jerry → Star Wars is a very good scout, but is of no value as a connector or promoter.', 'As illustrated here, a rating can have different value in each of the three roles in terms of whether a recommendation can be made or not.', 'We could measure this value by simply counting the number of times a rating is used in each role, which alone would be helpful in characterizing the behavior of a system.', 'But we can also measure the contribution of each rating to the quality of recommendations or health of the system.', 'Since every prediction is a combined effort of several recommendation paths, we are interested in discerning the influence of each rating (and, hence, each path) in the system towards the system\"s overall error.', 'We can understand the dynamics of the system at a finer granularity by tracking the influence of a rating according to the role played.', 'The next section describes the approach to measuring the values of a rating in each role.', 'CONTRIBUTIONS OF RATINGS As we\"ve seen, a rating may play different roles in different predictions and, in each prediction, contribute to the quality of a prediction in different ways.', 'Our approach can use any numeric measure of a property of system health, and assigns credit (or blame) to each rating proportional to its influence in the prediction.', 'By tracking the role of each rating in a prediction, we can accumulate the credit for a rating in each of the three roles, and also track the evolution of the roles of rating over time in the system.', 'We also demonstrate how these contributions can be aggregated to study the neighborhood of ratings involved in computing a user\"s recommendations.', 'Note that although our general formulation for rating influence is algorithm independent, due to space considerations, we present the approach for only item-based collaborative filtering.', 'A prediction of item i for a user u is computed as the weighted deviation from the item\"s mean rating as shown in Equation (4).', 'This is the change in the similarity between i and j when a\"s rating is removed, and is defined as impact(a, i, j) = |sim (i, j) − sim¯a(i, j)| P w∈Cij |sim (i, j) − sim ¯w(i, j)| where Cij = {u ∈ U | ∃ ru,i, ru,j ∈ R(u)} is the set of coraters 253 of items i and j (users who rate both i and j), R(u) is the set of ratings provided by user u, and sim¯a(i, j) is the similarity of i and j when the ratings of user a are removed sim¯a(i, j) = P v∈U\\\\{a} (ru,i − ¯ru)(ru,j − ¯ru) qP u∈U\\\\{a}(ru,i − ¯ru)2 qP u∈U\\\\{a}(ru,j − ¯ru)2 , and adjusted for the number of raters sim¯a(i, j) = max(|Ui ∩ Uj| − 1, γ) γ · sim(i, j).', '4.2 Role Values for Predictive Accuracy The value of a rating in each role is computed from the influence depending on the evaluation measure employed.', 'Anecdotal evidence suggests that users are unable to discern errors less than 1.0 (for a rating scale of 1 to 5) [4], and so an error less than 1.0 is considered acceptable, but anything larger is not.', 'In other words, the scout value SF(ru,j), the connector value CF(rv,j) and the promoter value PF(rv,i) are all incremented by the tribute amount.', 'Over a large number of predictions, scouts that have repeatedly resulted in big error rates have a big negative scout value, and vice versa (similarly with the other roles).', 'Every rating is thus summarized by its triple [SF, CF, PF].', '4.4 Aggregating rating roles After calculating the role values for individual ratings, we can also use these values to study neighborhoods and the system.', 'The collaborative filtering algorithm traversed many paths in his neighborhood through his scouts and other connectors and promoters to make these recommendations.', 'We call these ratings the recommender neighborhood of the user.', 'The user implicitly chooses this neighborhood of ratings through the items he rates.', 'Apart from the collaborative filtering algorithm, the health of this neighborhood completely influences a user\"s satisfaction with the system.', 'We can characterize a user\"s recommender neighborhood by aggregating the individual role values of the ratings involved, weighted by the influence of individual ratings in determining his recommended list.', 'Different sections of the user\"s neighborhood wield varied influence on his recommendation list.', 'A user can have a good set of scouts, but may be exposed to a neighborhood with bad connectors and promoters.', 'A user\"s neighborhood is characterized by a triple that represents the weighted sum of the role values of individual ratings involved in making recommendations.', 'The recommender neighborhood of a user u is characterized by the triple, [SFN(u), CFN(u), PFN(u)] where SFN(u) = X i∈L P [ru,j ,rv,j ,rv,i] SF(ru,j)influence(u, j, v, i) K(i) !', 'EXPERIMENTATION As we have seen, we can assign role values to each rating when evaluating a collaborative filtering system.', 'In this section, we demonstrate the use of this approach to our overall goal of defining an approach to monitor and manage the health of a recommender system through experiments done on the MovieLens million rating dataset.', 'In particular, we discuss results relating to identifying good scouts, promoters, and connectors; the evolution of rating roles; and the characterization of user neighborhoods.', '5.1 Methodology Our experiments use the MovieLens million rating dataset, which consists of ratings by 6040 users of 3952 movies.', 'The ratings are in the range 1 to 5, and are labeled with the time the rating was given.', 'Since we are interested in the evolution of the rating role values over time, the model of the recommender system is built by processing ratings in their arrival order.', 'We make assessments of rating roles at intervals of 10,000 ratings and processed the first 200,000 ratings in the dataset (giving rise to 20 snapshots).', 'The probability that every rating is considered for evaluation is then considerably high: 1 − 0.2n , where n is the number of times the experiment is repeated with different random seeds.', 'We claim that users with ratings that have respectable scout values will be happier with the system than those with ratings with low scout values.', 'The distribution of the scout values for most users\" ratings are Gaussian with mean zero.', '6 shows the frequency distribution of scout values for a sample user at a given snapshot.', 'A relatable scenario is when Amazon\"s recommender makes suggestions of books or items based on other items that were purchased as gifts.', 'An obvious question is whether good scouts can be formed by merely rating popular movies as suggested by Rashid et al.', 'They show that a mix of popularity and rating entropy identifies the best items to suggest to new users when evaluated using MAE.', 'We measured the Pearson correlation

scout values, we can identify movies that consistently feature in good scouts over time.', 'We found the aggregated scout values for all movies in intervals of 10,000 ratings each.', 'A movie is said to induce a good scout if the movie was in the top 100 of the sorted list, and to induce a bad scout if it was in bottom 100 of the same list.', 'Movies that would be bad scout choices are shown in Table 2 with their associated confidences.', 'Although more popular movies appear in the list of good scouts, these tables show that a blind choice of scout based on popularity alone can be potentially dangerous.', 'On the other hand, several factors may have made a movie a bad scout, like the sharp variance in user preferences in the neighborhood of a movie.', 'Two users may have the same opinion about Lawrence of Arabia, but they may differ sharply about how they felt about the other movies they saw.', 'We note that the frequency distribution of promoter values for a sample movie\"s ratings is also Gaussian (similar to Fig.', 'We find a strong correlation between a user\"s number of ratings and his aggregated promoter value.', '8 depicts the evolution of the Pearson correlation co-efficient between the prolificity of a user (number of ratings) versus his aggregated promoter value.', 'We expect that conspicuous shills, by recommending wrong movies to users, will be discredited with negative aggregate promoter values and should be identifiable easily.', 'Given this observation, the obvious rule to follow when introducing a new movie is to have it rated directly by prolific users who posses high aggregated promoter values.', 'A new movie is thus cast into the neighborhood of many other movies improving its visibility.', 'Tracking promoter values consistently allows only the most active recent users to be considered.', 'Good connectors are induced by ensuring a user with a high promoter value rates a movie with a high scout value.', 'A rating with a poor connector value is often seen due to its user being a bad promoter, or its movie being a bad scout.', '5.5 Monitoring the evolution of rating roles One of the more significant contributions of our work is the ability to model the evolution of recommender systems, by studying the changing roles of ratings over time.', 'The role and value of a rating can change depending on many factors like user behavior, redundancy, shilling effects or properties of the collaborative filtering algorithm used.', 'Studying the dynamics of rating roles in terms of transitions between good, bad, and negligible values can provide insights into the functioning of the recommender system.', 'We believe that a continuous visualization of these transitions will improve the ability to manage a recommender system.', 'We classify different rating states as good, bad, or negligible.', 'If a scout has a value greater than 0.005, it indicates that it is uniquely involved in at least 2 concordant predictions, which we will say is good.', 'Thus, a threshold of 0.005 is chosen to bin a rating as good, bad or negligible in terms of its scout, connector and promoter value.', 'For instance, a rating r, at time t with role value triple [0.1, 0.001, −0.01] is classified as [scout +, connector 0, promoter −], where + indicates good, 0 indicates negligible, and − indicates bad.', 'The positive credit held by a rating is a measure of its contribution to the betterment of the system, and the discredit is a measure of its contribution to the detriment of the system.', '257 Across different snapshots, a rating can remain in the same state or change.', 'A good scout can become a bad scout, a good promoter can become a good connector, good and bad scouts can become vestigial, and so on.', 'It is not practical to expect a recommender system to have no ratings in bad roles.', 'Thus, a rating can be in one of 27 possible states, and there are about 272 possible transitions.', 'We make a further simplification and utilize only 9 states, indicating whether the rating is a scout, promoter, or connector, and whether it has a positive, negative, or negligible role.', 'Scout + (2%)  Scout(1.5%) Scout 0 (96.5%) Connector + (1.2%)  Connector(0.8%) Connector 0 (98%) Promoter + (3%)  Promoter(2%) Promoter 0 (95%) 84% 84% 81% 74% 10% 6% 11% 77% 8% 7% 8% 82% 4% 86% 4% 68% 15% 13% 5% 5% 77% 11% 7% 5% 4% 3% 3% 3% Healthy Unhealthy Decaying Figure 9: Transitions among rating roles.', '• The negative and positive scout states are not reachable through any transition, indicating that these ratings must begin as such, and cannot be coerced into these roles.', 'This indicates that, over the long run, a user\"s rating is more useful to others (movies or other users) than to the user himself.', '9 is clearly useful for monitoring the health of a recommender system.', 'For instance, acceptable limits can be imposed on different types of transitions and, if a transition fails to meet the threshold, the recommender system or a part of it can be brought under closer scrutiny.', '5.6 Characterizing neighborhoods Earlier we saw that we can characterize the neighborhood of ratings involved in creating a recommendation list L for 258 a user.', 'In our experiment, we consider lists of length 30, and sample the lists of about 5% of users through the evolution of the model (at intervals of 10,000 ratings each) and compute their neighborhood characteristics.', 'As a remedy, users with bad scouts and a good neighborhood can be asked to reconsider rating of some movies hoping to improve the system\"s recommendations.', 'Users with good scouts and a bad neighborhood are harder to address; this situation might entail selectively removing some connector-promoter pairs that are causing the damage.', 'CONCLUSIONS To further recommender system acceptance and deployment, we require new tools and methodologies to manage an installed recommender and develop insights into the roles played by ratings.', 'A fine-grained characterization in terms of rating roles such as scouts, promoters, and connectors, as done here, helps such an endeavor.', 'Although we have presented results on only the item-based algorithm with list rank accuracy as the metric, the same approach outlined here applies to user-based algorithms and other metrics.', 'We also aim to extend our formulation to other collaborative filtering algorithms, study the effect of shilling in altering rating roles, conduct field studies, and evaluate improvements in user experience by tweaking ratings based on their role values.', 'Finally, we plan to develop the idea of mining the evolution of rating role patterns into a reporting and tracking system for all aspects of recommender system health.'], ['We illustrate our approach with a design task from a supply-chain trading competition.', 'Our empirical mechanism analysis models the relation between a key design parameter and outcomes,

Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT In this paper, we examine the relative forecast accuracy of information markets versus expert aggregation.', 'We leverage a unique data source of almost 2000 people\"s subjective probability judgments on 2003 US National Football League games and compare with the market probabilities given by two different information markets on exactly the same events.', 'Prices in information markets are used to derive market predictions.', 'When these conditions can not be met, non-statistical approaches that rely on judgmental information about the future event could be better choices.', 'Information markets (sometimes called prediction markets, idea markets, or event markets) are markets designed for aggregating information and making predictions about future events.', 'For example, in an information market to predict the result of a US professional National Football League (NFL) game, say New England vs Carolina, the security pays a certain amount of money per share to its holders if and only if New England wins the game.', 'The security price before the game reflects the consensus expectation of market traders about the probability of New England winning the game.', 'The Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX) [3] is a virtual (play-money) exchange for trading securities to forecast future box office proceeds of new movies, and the outcomes of entertainment awards, etc.', 'Since information markets, in nature, offer an adaptive and selforganized mechanism to aggregate opinions of market participants, it is interesting to compare them with existing opinion pooling methods, to evaluate the performance of information markets from another perspective.', 'In selecting the opinion pools to be used in our comparison, we find that arithmetic average is a robust and efficient pooling function; weighting expert assessments according to their past performances does not improve the prediction accuracy of opinion pools; and LogOP offers bolder predictions than LinOP.', 'Two of the most common pooling functions are the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP).', 'HOW INFORMATION MARKETS WORK Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market hypothesis [15].', 'Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in 1940\"s, claims that the price system in a competitive market is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed information among market participants.', 'The efficient market hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the price of a security almost instantly incorporates all available information.', 'The market price summarizes all relevant information across traders, hence is the market participants\" consensus expectation about the future value of the security.', 'For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an information market can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise.', 'The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.', 'Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.', 'Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game.', 'Observing the security price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants\" collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game.', 'Its price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be realized.', 'Many other aspects of a future event such as median value of outcome can also be predicted in information markets by designing and trading different securities.', 'For each NFL game, both TradeSports and NewsFutures have a winner-takes-all information market to predict the game outcome.', 'We introduce the design of the two markets according to Spann and Skiera\"s three steps for designing an information market [37] as below.', 'al [36] have compared the effect of money on the performance of the two information markets and concluded that the prediction accuracy of the two markets are at about the same level.', '4.2 Methods of Analysis In order to compare the prediction accuracy of information markets and that of opinion pools, we proceed to derive predictions from market data of TradeSports and NewsFutures, form pooled opinions using expert data from ProbabilityFootball contest, and specify the performance measures to be used.', 'We can take the security price and divide it by 100 to get the market\"s prediction of the probability that a team will win.', 'To match the time when participants at the ProbabilityFootball contest are required to report their probability assessments, we derive predictions using the last trade price before noon on the day of the game.', 'Two sets of market predictions are derived: • NF: Prediction equals NewsFutures\" last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100.', '• TS: Prediction equals TradeSports\" last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100.', 'Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.', 'For simplicity, we call performance-weighted opinion pool as weighted, and equally weighted opinion pool as unweighted.', 'For example, to form an opinion pool with 20 expert opinions, we choose the top 20 participants.', 'The possible opinion pools, varied in pooling functions, weighting methods, and number of expert opinions, are shown 61 Table 1: Pooled Expert Predictions # Symbol Description 1 Lin-All-u Unweighted (equally weighted) LinOP of all experts.', 'When a participant did not enter a prediction for a particular game, that participant was removed from the opinion pool for that game.', '4.2.2 Performance Measures We use three common metrics to assess prediction accuracy of information markets and opinion pools.', 'al [36] in evaluating the prediction accuracy of information markets.', 'We first examine the effect of number of opinions on prediction accuracy by forming opinion pools with the number of expert opinions varying from 1 to 960.', 'Predictions of the best performing n participants are picked to form an opinion pool with n experts.', 'Figure 1 shows the prediction accuracy of LinOP and LogOP in terms of mean values of the three performance measures across all 210 games.', 'When there are more than 200 experts, the prediction accuracy of LinOP is stable regarding the number of experts.', 'For LogOP, increasing the number of experts increases the prediction accuracy at the beginning.', 'But the curves (including the points with all experts) for mean quadratic score, and mean logarithmic score have slight bell-shapes, which represent a decrease in prediction accuracy when the number of experts is very large.', 'It is a very interesting observation that even if many participants of the ProbabilityFootball contest do not provide accurate individual predictions (they have negative quadratic scores in the contest), including their opinions into the opinion pool still increases the prediction accuracy.', 'One explanation of this phenomena could be that biases of individual judgment can offset with each other when opinions are diverse, which makes the pooled prediction more accurate.', 'The relative prediction accuracy of LogOP and LinOP flips when using different accuracy measures.', 'When the absolute error of an opinion

other two metrics.', 'If a prediction of the probability that a team will win a game, either from an opinion pool or an information market, is higher than 0.5, we say that the team is the predicted favorite for the game.', 'We then take a closer look at prediction accuracy of information markets and opinion pools using the three performance measures.', 'We employ the randomization test [32] to study whether the differences in prediction accuracy presented in Table 3 and Table 4 are statistically significant.', 'The basic idea of randomization test is that, by randomly swapping predictions of two methods numerous times, an empirical distribution for the difference of prediction accuracy can be constructed.', 'These results indicate that differences in prediction accuracy between information markets and opinion pools are not statistically significant.', 'Our treatment increases the prediction accuracy of Lin-All-u significantly.', 'However, information markets, as an adaptive mechanism to aggregate different opinions of market participants, have not been calibrated against many belief aggregation methods.', 'In this paper, we compare prediction accuracy of information markets with linear and logarithmic opinion pools (LinOP and LogOP) using predictions from two markets and 1966 individuals regarding the outcomes of 210 American football games during the 2003 NFL season.', 'We have selected four opinion pools to represent the prediction accuracy level that LinOP and LogOP can achieve.', 'With all four performance metrics, our two information markets obtain similar prediction accuracy as the four opinion pools.', 'Weighting expert opinions according to past performance does not seem to significantly improve prediction accuracy of either LinOP or LogOP.', 'But the advantages do not compromise their prediction accuracy to any extent.', 'It will be meaningful to investigate their relative prediction accuracy with other belief aggregation methods such as Bayesian approaches.', '• Whether defining expertise more narrowly can improve predictions of opinion pools.', 'If we define expertise more narrowly, selecting experts in certain football teams to predict games involving these teams, will the predictions of opinion pools be more accurate?', 'Chen, Fine, and Huberman [11] use an information market to determine the risk attitude of participants,

Communication Complexity of Common Voting Rules∗ Vincent Conitzer Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA conitzer@cs.cmu.edu Tuomas Sandholm Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA sandholm@cs.cmu.edu ABSTRACT We determine the communication complexity of the common voting rules.', 'The rules (sorted by their communication complexity from low to high) are plurality, plurality with runoff, single transferable vote (STV), Condorcet, approval, Bucklin, cup, maximin, Borda, Copeland, and ranked pairs.', 'For each rule, we first give a deterministic communication protocol and an upper bound on the number of bits communicated in it; then, we give a lower bound on (even the nondeterministic) communication requirements of the voting rule.', 'INTRODUCTION One key factor in the practicality of any preference aggregation rule is its communication burden.', 'To successfully aggregate the agents\" preferences, it is usually not necessary for all the agents to report all of their preference information.', 'This has at least the following advantages: • It can make preference aggregation feasible in settings where the total amount of preference information is too large to communicate.', '• Even when communicating all the preference information is feasible, reducing the communication requirements lessens the burden placed on the agents.', 'Most of the work on reducing the communication burden in preference aggregation has focused on resource allocation settings such as combinatorial auctions, in which an auctioneer auctions off a number of (possibly distinct) items in a single event.', 'Because in a combinatorial auction, bidders can have separate valuations for each of an exponential number of possible bundles of items, this is a setting in which reducing the communication burden is especially crucial.', 'Experimentally, this yields drastic savings in preference revelation [11].', 'Furthermore, if the agents\" valuation functions are drawn from certain natural subclasses, the elicitation problem can be solved using only polynomially many queries even in the worst case [23, 4, 13, 18, 14].', 'For a review of preference elicitation in combinatorial auctions, see [17].', 'Ascending combinatorial auctions are a well-known special form of preference elicitation, where the elicitor asks demand queries with increasing prices [15, 21, 1, 9].', 'Finally, resource 78 allocation problems have also been studied from a communication complexity viewpoint, thereby deriving lower bounds on the required communication.', 'For example, Nisan and Segal show that exponential communication is required even to obtain a surplus greater than that obtained by auctioning off all objects as a single bundle [14].', 'Segal then uses this characterization to prove bounds on the communication required in resource allocation as well as matching settings [20].', 'In this paper, we will focus on the communication requirements of a generally applicable subclass of social choice rules, commonly known as voting rules.', 'In a voting setting, there is a set of candidate outcomes over which the voters express their preferences by submitting a vote (typically, a ranking of the candidates), and the winner (that is, the chosen outcome) is determined based on these votes.', 'The communication required by voting rules can be large either because the number of voters is large (such as, for example, in national elections), or because the number of candidates is large (for example, the agents can vote over allocations of a number of resources), or both.', 'We determine the communication complexity of the common voting rules.', 'For each rule, we first give an upper bound on the (deterministic) communication complexity by providing a communication protocol for it and analyzing how many bits need to be transmitted in this protocol.', 'However, for some rules (such as plurality with runoff, STV and cup) there is a straightforward multistage communication protocol that, with some analysis, can be shown to significantly outperform the immediate communication of all (potentially relevant) information.', 'Finally, for some rules (such as the Condorcet and Bucklin rules), we need to introduce a more complex communication protocol to achieve the best possible upper 1 For two of the rules that we study that are intersectionmonotonic, namely the approval and Condorcet rules, Segal\"s results can in fact be used to give alternative proofs of our lower bounds.', 'After obtaining the upper bounds, we show that they are tight by giving matching lower bounds on (even the nondeterministic) communication complexity of each voting rule.', 'We do not concern ourselves with what happens in case of a tie between candidates (our lower bounds hold regardless of how ties are broken, and the communication protocols used for our upper bounds do not attempt to break the ties).', 'All of the rules that we study are rank-based rules, which means that a vote is defined as an ordering of the candidates (with the exception of the plurality rule, for which a vote is a single candidate, and the approval rule, for which a vote is a subset of the candidates).', '• single transferable vote (STV).', '2 The term voting protocol is often used to describe the same concept, but we seek to draw a sharp distinction between the rule mapping preferences to outcomes, and the communication/elicitation protocol used to implement this rule.', '79 • maximin (aka.', 'The maximin score of i is s(i) = minj=i N(i, j)-that is, i\"s worst performance in a pairwise election.', 'The candidate with the highest maximin score wins.', 'Thus, we distinguish between the voting rule (the mapping from vectors of votes to outcomes) and the communication protocol (which determines how the relevant parts of the votes are actually elicited from the voters).', 'The goal of this paper is to give efficient communication protocols for the voting rules just defined, and to prove that there do not exist any more efficient communication protocols.', 'It is interesting to note that the choice of the communication protocol may affect the strategic behavior of the voters.', 'Multistage communication protocols may reveal to the voters some information about how the other voters are voting (for example, in the two-stage communication protocol just given for plurality with runoff, in the second stage voters 3 Balanced means that the difference in depth between two leaves can be at most one.', 'In general, when the voters receive such information, it may give them incentives to vote differently than they would have in a single-stage communication protocol in which all voters declare their entire votes simultaneously.', 'Of course, even the single-stage communication protocol is not strategy-proof4 for any reasonable voting rule, by the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem [10, 19].', 'In fact, many of the communication protocols introduced in this paper do introduce additional opportunities for strategic voting, but we do not have the space to discuss this here.', '(In prior work [8], we do give an example where an elicitation protocol for the approval voting rule introduces strategic voting, and give principles for designing elicitation protocols that do not introduce strategic problems.)', 'Now that we have reviewed voting rules, we move on to a brief review of communication complexity theory.', '3. REVIEW OF SOME COMMUNICATION COMPLEXITY THEORY In this section, we review the basic model of a communication problem and the lower-bounding technique of constructing a fooling set.', '(The basic model of a communication problem is due to Yao [22]; for an overview see Kushilevitz and Nisan [12].)', 'In a deterministic protocol for computing f, in each stage, one of the players announces (to all other players) a bit of information based on her own input and the bits announced so far.', 'Eventually, the communication terminates and all players know f(x1, x2, .', 'The deterministic communication complexity of a problem is the worstcase number of bits sent in the best (correct) deterministic protocol for it.', 'For the purposes of this paper, we will consider a nondeterministic protocol correct if for every input vector, there is some sequence of nondeterministic choices the players can make so that the players know the value of f when the protocol terminates.', 'The nondeterministic communication complexity of a problem is the worst-case number of bits sent in the best (correct) nondeterministic protocol for it.', 'It is known that if a fooling set of size k exists, then log k is a lower bound on the communication complexity (even the nondeterministic communication complexity) [12].', '4 A strategy-proof protocol is one in which it is in the players\" best interest to report their preferences truthfully.', '80 For the purposes of this paper, f is the voting rule that maps the votes to the winning candidate, and xi is voter i\"s vote (the information that the voting rule would require from the voter if there were no possibility of multistage communication-i.e.', 'This will strengthen our lower bound results (because it implies that even finding out whether one given candidate wins is hard).5 Thus, a fooling set in our context is a set of vectors of votes so that a wins (does not win) with each of them; but for any two different vote vectors in the set, there is a way of taking some voters\" votes from the first vector and the others\" votes from the second vector, so that a does not win (wins).', 'For each voting rule, we first give a deterministic communication protocol for determining the winner to establish an upper bound.', 'Then, we give a lower bound on the nondeterministic communication complexity (even on the complexity of deciding whether a given candidate wins, which is an easier question).', 'The lower bounds match the upper bounds in all but two cases: the STV rule (upper bound O(n(log m)2 ); lower bound Ω(n log m)) and the maximin rule (upper bound O(nm log m), although we do give a nondeterministic protocol that is O(nm); lower bound Ω(nm)).', 'When we discuss a voting rule in which the voters rank the candidates, we will represent a ranking in which candidate c1 is ranked first, c2 is ranked second, etc.', '5 One possible concern is that in the case where ties are possible, it may require much communication to verify whether a specific candidate a is among the winners, but little communication to produce one of the winners.', 'Thus, computing one of the winners requires at least as much communication as verifying whether a is among the winners.', 'In general, when a communication problem allows multiple correct answers for a given vector of inputs, this is known as computing a relation rather than a function [12].', 'However, as per the above, we can restrict our attention to a subset of the domain where the voting rule truly is a (single-valued) function, and hence lower bounding techniques for functions rather than relations will suffice.', 'The deterministic communication complexity of any rank-based voting rule is O(nm log m).', 'The deterministic communication

tools from game theory to rationally decide on an action.', 'A Nash equilibrium specifies a strategy for each player, in such a way that no player has an incentive to (unilaterally) deviate from the prescribed strategy.', 'The problem of computing solutions according to the perhaps more elementary solution concepts of dominance and iterated dominance has received much less attention.', '(After an early short paper on an easy case [11], the main computational study of these concepts has actually taken place in a paper in the game theory community [7].1 ) A strategy strictly dominates another strategy if it performs strictly 1 This is not to say that computer scientists have ignored 88 better against all vectors of opponent strategies, and weakly dominates it if it performs at least as well against all vectors of opponent strategies, and strictly better against at least one.', 'In iterated dominance, the elimination proceeds in rounds, and becomes easier as more strategies are eliminated: in any given round, the dominating strategy no longer needs to perform better than or as well as the dominated strategy against opponent strategies that were eliminated in earlier rounds.', 'Computing solutions according to (iterated) dominance is important for at least the following reasons: 1) it can be computationally easier than computing (for instance) a Nash equilibrium (and therefore it can be useful as a preprocessing step in computing a Nash equilibrium), and 2) (iterated) dominance requires a weaker rationality assumption on the players than (for instance) Nash equilibrium, and therefore solutions derived according to it are more likely to occur.', 'In this paper, we study some fundamental computational questions concerning dominance and iterated dominance, including how hard it is to check whether a given strategy can be eliminated by each of the variants of these notions.', 'In the remaining sections, we study computational aspects of dominance and iterated dominance.', 'In Section 5, we study dominance and iterated dominance when the dominating strategy can only place probability on a few pure strategies.', 'Finally, in Section 6, we study dominance and iterated dominance in Bayesian games.', 'DEFINITIONS AND BASIC PROPERTIES In this section, we briefly review normal form games, as well as dominance and iterated dominance (both strict and weak).', 'An n-player normal form game is defined as follows.', 'A normal form game is given by a set of players {1, 2, . . . , n}; and, for each player i, a (finite) set of pure strategies Σi and a utility function ui : Σ1 × Σ2 × .', 'The two main notions of dominance are defined as follows.', 'Player i\"s strategy σi is said to be strictly dominated by player i\"s strategy σi if for any vector of strategies σ−i for the other players, ui(σi, σ−i) > ui(σi, σ−i).', 'Player i\"s strategy σi is said to be weakly dominated by player i\"s strategy σi if for any vector of strategies σ−i for the other players, ui(σi, σ−i) ≥ ui(σi, σ−i), and for at least one vector of strategies σ−i for the other players, ui(σi, σ−i) > ui(σi, σ−i).', 'In this definition, it is sometimes allowed for the dominating strategy σi to be a mixed strategy, that is, a probability distribution over pure strategies.', 'In this case, the utilities in dominance altogether.', 'For example, simple dominance checks are sometimes used as a subroutine in searching for Nash equilibria [21].', 'the definition are the expected utilities.2 There are other notions of dominance, such as very weak dominance (in which no strict inequality is required, so two strategies can dominate each other), but we will not study them here.', 'When we are looking at the dominance relations for player i, the other players (−i) can be thought of as a single player.3  Therefore, in the rest of the paper, when we study one-shot (not iterated) dominance, we will focus without loss of generality on two-player games.4 In two-player games, we will generally refer to the players as r (row) and c (column) rather than 1 and 2.', 'In iterated dominance, dominated strategies are removed from the game, and no longer have any effect on future dominance relations.', 'Iterated dominance can eliminate more strategies than dominance, as follows.', 'L R U 1, 1 0, 0 D 0, 1 1, 0 Either strict or weak dominance can be used in the definition of iterated dominance.', 'We note that the process of iterated dominance is never helped by removing a dominated mixed strategy, for the following reason.', 'If σi gives player i a higher utility than σi against mixed strategy σj for player j = i (and strategies σ−{i,j} for the other players), then for at least one pure strategy σj that σj places positive probability on, σi must perform better than σi against σj (and strategies σ−{i,j} for the other players).', 'Thus, removing the mixed strategy σj does not introduce any new dominances.', 'More detailed discussions and examples can be found in standard texts on microeconomics or game theory [17, 5].', 'DOMINANCE (NOT ITERATED) In this section, we study the notion of one-shot (not iterated) dominance.', 'As a first observation, checking whether a given strategy is strictly (weakly) dominated by some pure strategy is straightforward, by checking, for every pure strategy for that player, whether the latter strategy performs strictly better against all the opponent\"s strategies (at least as well against all the opponent\"s strategies, and strictly 2 The dominated strategy σi is, of course, also allowed to be mixed, but this has no technical implications for the paper: when we study one-shot dominance, we ask whether a given strategy is dominated, and it does not matter whether the given strategy is pure or mixed; when we study iterated dominance, there is no use in eliminating mixed strategies, as we will see shortly.', '3 This player may have a very large strategy space (one pure strategy for every vector of pure strategies for the players that are being replaced).', '89 better against at least one).5 Next, we show that checking whether a given strategy is dominated by some mixed strategy can be done in polynomial time by solving a single linear program.', 'Given the row player\"s utilities, a subset Dr of the row player\"s pure strategies Σr, and a distinguished strategy σ∗ r for the row player, we can check in time polynomial in the size of the game (by solving a single linear program of polynomial size) whether there exists some mixed strategy σr, that places positive probability only on strategies in Dr and dominates σ∗ r , both for strict and for weak dominance.', 'For strict dominance, the question is whether the pdr can be set so that for every pure strategy for the column player σc ∈ Σc, dr∈Dr pdr ur(dr, σc) > ur(σ∗ r , σc).', '(The dominating strategy is a feasible solution with objective value exactly 1.', 'Moreover, if this linear program has a solution with objective value < 1, there is a mixed strategy strictly dominating σ∗ r , which can be obtained by taking the LP solution and adding the remaining probability to any strategy (because all the utilities are positive, this will add to the left side of any inequality, so all inequalities will become strict).', 'If σ∗ r is weakly dominated by some mixed strategy, then that mixed strategy is a feasible solution to this program with objective value > 0, because for at least one strategy σc ∈ Σc we have ( dr∈Dr pdr ur(dr, σc)) − ur(σ∗ r , σc) > 0.', 'On the other hand, if this program has a solution with objective value > 0, then for at least one strategy σc ∈ Σc we 5 Recall that the assumption of a single opponent (that is, the assumption of two players) is without loss of generality for one-shot dominance.', 'ITERATED DOMINANCE We now move on to iterated dominance.', 'It is well-known that iterated strict dominance is path-independent [6, 19]that is, if we remove dominated strategies until no more dominated strategies remain, in the end the remaining strategies for each player will be the same, regardless of the order in which strategies are removed.', 'Because of this, to see whether a given strategy can be eliminated by iterated strict dominance, all that needs to be done is to repeatedly remove strategies that are strictly dominated, until no more dominated strategies remain.', 'Because we can check in polynomial time whether any given strategy is dominated (whether or not dominance by mixed strategies is allowed, as described in Section 3), this whole procedure takes only polynomial time.', 'In the case of iterated dominance by pure strategies with two players, Knuth et al.', '[11] slightly improve on (speed up) the straightforward implementation of this procedure by keeping track of, for each ordered pair of strategies for a player, the number of opponent strategies that prevent the first strategy from dominating the second.', '(Actually, they only study very weak dominance (for which no strict inequalities are required), but the approach is easily extended.)', 'In contrast, iterated weak dominance is known to be pathdependent.6 For example, in the following game, using iterated weak dominance we can eliminate M first, and then D, or R first, and then U. L M R U 1, 1 0, 0 1, 0 D 1, 1 1, 0 0, 0 Therefore, while the procedure of removing weakly dominated strategies until no more weakly dominated strategies remain can certainly be executed in polynomial time, which strategies survive in the end depends on the order in which we remove the dominated strategies.', 'We will investigate two questions for iterated weak dominance: whether a given strategy is eliminated in some path, and whether there is a path to a unique solution (one pure strategy left per player).', 'Given a game in normal form and a distinguished strategy σ∗ , IWD-STRATEGY-ELIMINATION asks whether there is some path of iterated weak dominance that eliminates σ∗ .', 'Given a game in normal form, IWDUNIQUE-SOLUTION asks whether there is some path of iterated weak dominance that leads to a unique solution (one strategy left per player).', 'The following lemma shows a special case of normal form games in which allowing for weak dominance by mixed strategies (in addition to weak dominance by pure strategies) does 6 There is, however, a restriction of weak dominance called nice weak dominance which is path-independent [15, 16].', 'We will prove the hardness results in this setting, so that they will hold whether or not dominance by mixed strategies is allowed.', 'Then every pure strategy that is weakly dominated by a mixed strategy is also weakly dominated by a pure strategy.', 'Suppose pure strategy σ is weakly dominated by mixed strategy σ∗ .', 'If σ gets a utility of 1 against some opponent strategy (or vector of opponent strategies if there are more than 2 players), then all the pure strategies that σ∗ places positive probability on must also get a utility of 1 against that opponent strategy (or else the expected utility would be smaller than 1).', 'Moreover, at least one of the pure strategies that σ∗ places positive probability on must get a utility of 1 against an opponent strategy that σ gets 0 against (or else the inequality would never be strict).', 'It follows that this pure strategy weakly dominates σ.', 'IWD-STRATEGY-ELIMINATION is NPcomplete, even with 2 players, and with 0 and 1 being the only utilities occurring in the matrix-whether or not dominance by mixed strategies is allowed.', 'The problem is in NP because given a sequence of strategies to be eliminated, we can easily check whether this is a valid sequence of eliminations (even when dominance by mixed strategies is allowed, using Proposition 1).', 'A strategy σr can be made uneliminable, even when 0 and 1 are the only allowed utilities, by adding another strategy σr and another opponent strategy σc, so that: 1. σr and σr are the only strategies that give the row player a utility of 1 against σc.', '3. σc is the only strategy that gives the column player a utility of 1 against σr, but otherwise σc always gives the column player utility 0.', 'Let the row player\"s pure strategy set be given as follows.', 'Additionally, the row player has the following 2 strategies: s1 0 and s2 0, where s2 0 = σ∗ r (that is, it is the strategy we seek to eliminate).', 'Finally, for every clause c ∈ C, the row player has corresponding strategies s1 c (uneliminable) and s2 c.

'We show analytically and through simulations that despite being highly decentralized, such a system converges quickly to an equilibrium and unlike the social optimum that achieves high efficiency but poor fairness, the proposed allocation scheme achieves a nice balance of high degrees of efficiency and fairness at the equilibrium.', 'However, resource allocation in these systems remains the major challenge.', 'The problem is how to allocate a shared resource both fairly and efficiently (where efficiency is the ratio of the achieved social welfare to the social optimal) with the presence of strategic users who act in their own interests.', 'Instead, we examine a market-based resource allocation system (others are described in [2, 4, 6, 21, 26, 27]) that allows users to express their preferences for resources through a bidding mechanism.', 'In this work, we examine a price-anticipating scheme in the context of allocating computational capacity for users with private preferences and limited budgets, resulting in a qualitatively different game (as discussed in Section 6).', 'In this paper, we formulate the fixed budget resource allocation game and study the existence and performance of the Nash equilibria of this game.', 'Although rarely considered in previous game theoretical study, we believe fairness is a critical metric for a resource allocation schemes because the perception of unfairness will cause some users to reject a system with more efficient, but less fair resource allocation in favor of one with less efficient, more fair resource allocation.', 'We use both utility uniformity and envy-freeness to measure fairness.', 'Using analysis, we show that there is always a Nash equilibrium in the fixed budget game if the utility functions satisfy a fairly weak and natural condition of strong competitiveness.', 'We also show the worst case performance bounds: for m players the efficiency at equilibrium is Ω(1/ √ m), the utility uniformity is ≥ 1/m, and the envyfreeness ≥ 2 √ 2−2 ≈ 0.83.', 'As part of the fixed budget game analysis, we show that strategic users with linear utility functions can calculate their bids using a best response algorithm that quickly results in an allocation with high efficiency with little computational and communication overhead.', 'We present variations of the best response algorithm for both finite and infinite parallelism tasks.', 'In addition, we present a local greedy adjustment algorithm that converges more slowly than best response, but allows for non-linear or unformulatable utility functions.', '• We show that the price-anticipating resource allocation mechanism achieves a high degree of efficiency and fairness.', 'Intuition would suggest that efficiency and fairness are exclusive.', 'Surprisingly, the Nash equilibrium, reached by each user iteratively applying the best response algorithm to adapt his bids, achieves nearly the efficiency of the social optimum and nearly the fairness of the weight-proportional allocation: the efficiency is ≥ 0.90, the utility uniformity is ≥ 0.65, and the envyfreeness is ≥ 0.97, independent of the number of users in the system.', 'The local adjustment algorithm performs similarly when there is sufficient competitiveness, but takes 25 to 90 iterations to stabilize.', 'As a result, we believe that shared distributed systems based on the fixed budget game can be highly decentralized, yet achieve a high degree of efficiency and fairness.', 'We describe the model in Section 2 and derive the performance at the Nash equilibria for the infinite parallelism model in Section 3.', 'In Section 4, we describe algorithms for users to optimize their own utility in the fixed budget game.', 'In Section 5, we describe our simulator and simulation results.', 'Each user i\"s utility is represented by a function Ui of the fraction (ri1, .', 'Therefore, the basic utility function we consider is the linear utility function: Ui(ri1, · · · , rin) = wi1ri1 +· · ·+winrin, where wij ≥ 0 is user i\"s private preference, also called his weight, on machine j.', 'Our definition of utility functions corresponds to the user having enough jobs or enough parallelism within jobs to utilize all the machines.', 'We call this the infinite parallelism model.', 'To model this, we also consider the more realistic finite parallelism model, where the user\"s parallelism is bounded by ki, and the user\"s utility Ui is the sum of the ki largest wijrij.', 'In Section 7, we discuss the limit of the above definition of utility functions.', 'As typically, we assume the users are selfish and strategic - they all act to maximize their own utility, defined by their utility functions.', 'We will show later how to solve it for the infinite parallelism model and provide a heuristic for finite parallelism model.', 'To rule out this case, we consider those strongly competitive games.1 Under the infinite parallelism model, a game is called strongly competitive if for any 1 ≤ j ≤ n, there exists an i = k such that wij, wkj > 0.', 'Given the existence of the Nash equilibrium, the next important question is the performance at the Nash equilibrium, which is often measured by its efficiency and fairness.', 'The efficiency at an allocation scheme ω is defined as π(ω) = U(ω) U∗ .', 'Ω0 = ∅, define the efficiency of a game Q to be π(Q) = minω∈Ω0 π(ω).', 'there is an efficiency loss at a Nash equilibrium.', 'This is the price of anarchy [18] paid for not having central enforcement of the user\"s good behavior.', 'While the definition of efficiency is standard, there are multiple ways to define fairness.', 'The utility uniformity τ(ω) of an allocation scheme ω is defined to be mini Ui(ω) maxi Ui(ω) , the ratio of the minimum utility and the maximum utility among the users.', 'Such definition (or utility discrepancy defined similarly as maxi Ui(ω) mini Ui(ω) ) is used extensively in Computer Science literature.', 'Under this definition, the utility uniformity τ(Q) of a game Q is defined to be τ(Q) = minω∈Ω0 τ(ω).', 'Unlike the utility uniformity metric, the enviness concerns how the user perceives the value of the share assigned to him, compared to the shares other users receive.', 'NASH EQUILIBRIUM In this section, we present some theoretical results regarding the performance at Nash equilibrium under the infinite parallelism model.', 'For a meaningful discussion of efficiency and fairness, we assume that the users are symmetric by requiring that Xi = 1 andPn j=1 wij = 1 for all the 1 ≤ i ≤ m. Or informally, we require all the users have the same budget, and they have the same utility when they own all the resources.', 'This precludes the case when a user has an extremely high budget, resulting in very low efficiency or low fairness at equilibrium.', 'Under the infinite parallelism model, it is easy to compute the social optimum U∗ as it is achieved when we allocate each machine wholly to the person who has the maximum weight on the machine, i.e.', 'At the equilibrium, the utility of each user is 1/2, and the social welfare is 1.', 'Thus, the equal-weight game is ideal as the efficiency, utility uniformity, and the envyfreeness are all 1.', 'Those asymmetric equilibria at δ = 1 are bad as they yield lower efficiency than the symmetric equilibrium.', 'For the general two player game, we can show that 0.75 is actually the worst efficiency bound with a proof in [5].', 'Further, at the asymmetric equilibrium, the utility uniformity approaches 1/2 when α → 1.', 'This is the worst possible for two player games because as we show in Section 3.2, a user\"s utility at any Nash equilibrium is at least 1/m in the m-player game.', 'At this equilibrium, each of the first n2 players receives 1 n 1/n n+1 = 1 n2(n+1) on each machine, resulting in a total utility of n3 · 1 n2(n+1) < 1.', 'The other n players each receives 1 n+1 on their favorite machine, resulting in a total utility of n · 1 n+1 < 1.', 'Therefore, the total utility of the equilibrium is < 2, while the social optimum is n = Θ( √ m).', 'What about the utility uniformity of the multi-player allocation game?', 'We next show that the utility uniformity of the m-player allocation game cannot exceed m. Let (S1, .', 'User i can ensure a utility of 1/m by distributing his budget proportionally to the current bids.', 'Therefore, rij = 1 1+m−1 = 1 m . The total utility of user i is nX j=1 rijwij = (1/m) nX j=1 wij = 1/m .', 'Since each user\"s utility cannot exceed 1, the minimal possible uniformity is 1/m.', 'While the utility uniformity can be small, the envy-freeness, on the other hand, is bounded by a constant of 2 √ 2 − 2 ≈ 0.828, as shown in [29].', 'ALGORITHMS In the previous section, we present the performance bounds of the game under the infinite parallelism model.', 'However, the more interesting questions in practice are how the equilibrium can be reached and what is the performance at the Nash equilibrium for the typical distribution of utility functions.', 'In particular, we would like to know if the intuitive strategy of each player constantly re-adjusting his bids according to the best response algorithm leads to the equilibrium.', 'We consider both the infinite parallelism and finite parallelism model.', '130 4.1 Infinite Parallelism Model As we mentioned before, it is easy to compute the social optimum under the infinite parallelism model - we simply assign each machine to the user who likes it the most.', 'We now present the algorithm for computing the best response.', 'Thus, we obtain the following algorithm to compute the best response of a user: 1.', 'The computational complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n), dominated by the sorting.', 'The best response algorithm must send and receive O(n) messages because each user must obtain the total bids from each host.', '4.2 Finite Parallelism Model Recall that in the finite parallelism model, each user i only places bids on at most ki machines.', 'Of course, the infinite parallelism model is just a special case of finite parallelism model in which ki = n for all the i\"s. In the finite parallelism model, computing the social optimum is no longer trivial due to bounded parallelism.', 'The social optimum is the same as the maximum weight matching of G. Thus, we can use the maximum weight matching algorithm to compute the social optimum.', 'We choose to implement the Hungarian algorithm [14, 19] because of its simplicity.', 'There may exist a more efficient algorithm for computing the maximum matching by exploiting the special structure of G. This remains an interesting open question.', 'However, we do not know an efficient algorithm to compute the best response under the finite parallelism model.', 'Let the user\"s budget be X and the parallelism bound be k. Our goal is to compute an allocation of X to up to k machines to maximize the user\"s utility.', 'For a subset of machines A, denote by x(A) the best response on A without parallelism bound and by U(A) the utility obtained by the best response algorithm.', 'Compute U(A) by the infinite parallelism best response algorithm (Sec 4.1) on A.', 'We suspect that the local maxima that this algorithm finds is also the global maximum (with respect to an individual user) and that this process stop after a few number of iterations, but we are unable to establish it.', 'However, in our simulations, this algorithm quickly converges to a high (≥ .7) efficiency.', '131 4.3 Local Greedy Adjustment The above best response algorithms only work for the linear utility functions described earlier.', 'In practice, utility functions may have more a complicated form, or even worse, a user may not have a formulation of his utility function.', 'We do assume that the user still has a way to measure his utility, which is the minimum assumption necessary for any market-based resource allocation mechanism.', 'He then moves a fixed small amount of money from the machine with low marginal utility to the machine with the higher one.', 'This condition guarantees the allocation is the optimum when the utility function is concave.', 'SIMULATION RESULTS While the analytic results provide us with worst-case analysis for the infinite parallelism model, in this section we employ simulations to study the properties of the Nash equilibria in more realistic scenarios and for the finite parallelism model.', 'Second, in cases of convergence, we look at the performance at equilibrium, using the efficiency and fairness metrics defined above.', 'Thus, a high convergence rate may be more significant than the efficiency at the equilibrium.', 'The less strict utility gap criterion requires there to be only negligible change in the users\" utility.', 'Indeed, in practice, the user is probably not willing to re-allocate their bids dramatically for a small utility gain.', 'Therefore, we use the utility gap criterion to measure convergence time for the best response update method, i.e.', 'we consider that the system has converged if the utility gap of each user is smaller than (0.001 in our experiments).', 'However, this criterion does not work for the local greedy adjustment method because users of that method will experience constant fluctuations in utility as they move money around.', 'For this method, we use the marginal utility gap criterion.', 'We compare the highest and lowest utility margins on the machines.', 'Individual users\" utility may not have converged.', 'This criterion is useful to evaluate how quickly the system as a whole reaches a particular efficiency level.', 'Sections 5.1 and 5.2 present the simulation results when we apply the infinite parallelism and finite parallelism models, respectively.', 'A convergence time of 200 iterations indicates non-convergence, in which case we report the efficiency and fairness values at the point we terminate the simulation.', '5.1 Infinite parallelism In this section, we apply the infinite parallelism model, which assumes that users can use an unlimited number of machines.', 'We present the efficiency and fairness at the equilibrium, compared to two baseline allocation methods: social optimum and weight-proportional, in which users distribute their bids proportionally to their weights on the machines (which may seem a reasonable distribution method intuitively).', 'Figure 2 shows the

design problem where the optimal mechanism is the one that brings the seller the most profit.', 'Here, the classical approach is to design such a mechanism given the prior distribution from which the bidders\" preferences are drawn (See e.g., [12, 4]).', '[9] introduced the use of worst-case competitive analysis (See e.g., [3]) to analyze the performance of auctions that have no knowledge of the prior distribution.', 'The goal of such work is to design an auction that achieves a large constant fraction of the profit attainable by an optimal mechanism that knows the prior distribution in advance.', 'Positive results in this direction are fueled by the observation that in auctions for a number of identical units, much of the distribution from which the bidders are drawn can be deduced on the fly by the auction as it is being run [9, 14, 2].', 'The performance of an auction in such a worst-case competitive analysis is measured by its competitive ratio, the ratio between a benchmark performance and the auction\"s performance on the input distribution that maximizes this ratio.', 'The holy grail of the worstcase competitive analysis of auctions is the auction that achieves the optimal competitive ratio (as small as possible).', 'Since [9] this search has led to improved understanding of the nature of the optimal auction, the techniques for on-the-fly pricing in these scenarios, and the competitive ratio of the optimal auction [5, 7, 8].', 'Furthermore, we give evidence corroborating the conjecture that the form of the optimal auction is independent of the benchmark used in the auction\"s competitive analysis.', 'This result further validates the use of competitive analysis in gauging auction performance.', 'We consider the single item, multi-unit, unit-demand auction problem.', 'In such an auction there are many units of a single item available for sale to bidders who each desire only one unit.', 'The auction is performed by soliciting a sealed bid from each of the bidders and deciding on the allocation of units to bidders and the prices to be paid by the bidders.', 'To handle the problem of designing and analyzing auctions where bidders may falsely declare their valuations to get a better deal, we will adopt the solution concept of truthful mechanism design (see, e.g., [9, 15, 13]).', 'A particularly interesting special case of the auction problem is the unlimited supply case.', 'The competitive framework introduced in [9] and further refined in [5] uses the profit of the optimal omniscient single priced mechanism that sells at least two units as the benchmark for competitive analysis.', 'In this framework for competitive analysis, an auction is said to be β-competitive if it achieves a profit that is within a factor of β ≥ 1 of the benchmark profit on every input.', 'The optimal auction is the one which is β-competitive with the minimum value of β.', 'Previous to this work, the best known auction for the unlimited

finding an alternative repair solution of adequate revenue without causing undue disturbance to the remaining winning bids in the original solution may be difficult or even impossible.', 'When faced with such unreliable bidders, it is preferable for the bid-taker to preempt such uncertainty by having a solution that is robust to bid withdrawal and provides a guarantee that possible withdrawals may be repaired easily with a bounded loss in revenue.', 'A weighted super solution guarantees that any subset of bids likely to be withdrawn can be repaired to form a new solution of at least a given revenue by making limited changes.', 'Secondly, we introduce an auction model that uses a form of leveled commitment contract [26, 27], which we have called mutual bid bonds, to improve solution

different constraints on the revenue of repair solutions.', 'INTRODUCTION A combinatorial auction (CA) [5] provides an efficient means of allocating multiple distinguishable items amongst bidders whose perceived valuations for combinations of items differ.', 'In terms of combinatorial auctions, a robust solution is one that can withstand bid withdrawal (a break) by making changes easily to form a repair solution of adequate revenue.', 'A brittle solution to a CA is one in which an unacceptable loss in revenue is unavoidable if a winning bid is withdrawn.', 'Section 2 presents the Winner Determination Problem (WDP) for combinatorial auctions, outlines some possible reasons for bid withdrawal and shows how simply maximizing expected revenue can lead to intolerable revenue losses for risk-averse bid-takers.', 'This motivates the use of robust solutions and Section 3 introduces a constraint programming (CP) framework, Weighted Super Solutions [13], that finds such solutions.', 'We then propose an auction model in Section 4 that enhances reparability by introducing mandatory mutual bid bonds, that may be seen as a form of leveled commitment contract [26, 27].', 'Section 5 presents an extensive empirical evaluation of the approach presented in this paper, in the context of a number of well-known combinatorial auction distributions, with very encouraging results.', 'COMBINATORIAL AUCTIONS Before presenting the technical details of our solution to the Bid-taker\"s Exposure Problem, we shall present a brief survey of combinatorial auctions and existing techniques for handling bid withdrawal.', 'A bid is a tuple Bj = Sj, pj where Sj ⊆ M is a subset of the items for sale and pj ≥ 0 is a price.', '2.1 The Problem of Bid Withdrawal We assume an auction protocol with a three stage process involving the submission of bids, winner determination, and finally a transaction phase.', 'We are interested in bid withdrawals that occur between the announcement of winning bids and the end of the transaction phase.', 'For example, if the item is a service contract for a given period of time and the break occurs after partial fulfilment of this contract, the

deadlines are not met.', 'We refer to bid withdrawal by the bid-taker as item withdrawal in this paper to distinguish between the actions of a bidder and the bid-taker.', 'Harstad and Rothkopf [8] outlined several possibilities for breaks in single item auctions that include: 1. an erroneous initial valuation/bid; 2. unexpected events outside the winning bidder\"s control; 3. a desire to have the second-best bid honored; 4. information obtained or events that occurred after the auction but before the transaction that reduces the value of an item; 5. the revelation of competing bidders\" valuations infers reduced profitability, a problem known as the Winner\"s Curse.', 'These perturbations may include bid withdrawals, change of valuation/items of a bid or the submission of a new bid.', '2.2 Being Proactive against Bid Withdrawal When a bid is withdrawn there may be constraints on how the solution can be repaired.', 'Alternatively, the bidder who reneged upon a bid may have all his other bids disqualified and the items could be reassigned based on the optimum solution without that bidder present.', 'Consider the example in Table 1, and the optimal expected revenue in the situation where a single bid may be withdrawn.', 'There are three submitted bids for items A and B, the third being a combination bid for the pair of items at a value of 190.', 'Items Bids A B AB

other winning bidder.', 'Consider the previous example where the bid amount for x3 becomes 175.', 'Our approach can be seen as preventative in that we find an initial allocation of items to bidders which is robust to bid withdrawal.', 'A robust solution for a combinatorial auction is one where any subset of successful bids whose probability of withdrawal is greater than or equal to α can be repaired by reassigning items at a cost of at most β to other previously losing bids to form a repair solution.', 'FINDING ROBUST SOLUTIONS In constraint programming [4] (CP), a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is modeled as a set of n variables X = {x1, .', 'A classical super solution (SS) is a solution to a CSP in which, if a small number of variables lose their values, repair solutions are guaranteed with only a few changes, thus providing solution robustness [9, 10].', 'The inertia of a bid reflects the cost of changing its state.', 'Each bid is represented by a single

Coalitional Game Representation To capture the coalitional games described above and perform computations on them, we must first find a representation for these games.', 'Therefore, it is critical to

of games, one may be able to develop a representation scheme that is tailored and more compact than a general scheme.', 'For example, for the recommendation system game, a highly compact representation would be one that simply states which agents know of which products, and let the algorithms that operate on the representation to compute the values of coalitions appropriately.', 'By having a general representation and efficient algorithms that go with it, the representation will be useful as a prototyping tool for studying new economic situations.', '1.3 Previous Work The

should be sufficient structure in the problem such that our representation achieves a net saving over the characteristic form.', '3.3 Representation Power We will discuss the expressiveness and

concise than multi-issue representation for certain games.', 'Under the agent graph interpretation of MC-nets, we can see that MC-nets is a generalization of the graphical representation in [4],

conciseness of this price representation is very important for computational tractability within the exchange and also to promote simplicity and transparency for bidders.', 'The following can be

ABSTRACT Weak monotonicity is a simple necessary condition for a social choice function to be implementable by a truthful mechanism.', 'Lavi, Mu\"alem and Nisan [6] proved the sufficiency of weak monotonicity for functions over order-based domains and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] proved sufficiency for order-based domains with range constraints and for domains defined by other special types of linear inequality constraints.', 'Here we show the more general result, conjectured by Lavi, Mu\"alem and Nisan [6], that weak monotonicity is sufficient for functions defined on any convex domain.', 'An important approach for dealing with this problem is to augment a given social choice function with a payment function, which assigns to each player a (positive or negative) payment as a function of all of the individual preferences.', 'A social choice function augmented with a payment function is called a mechanism 1 and the mechanism is said to implement the social choice function.', 'A mechanism is truthful (or to be strategyproof or to have a dominant strategy) if each player\"s best strategy, knowing the preferences of the others, is always to declare his own true preferences.',

terms of obstructions each having domain size 2, this provides a complete set of minimal obstructions for truthfulness within the class of social choice functions with convex domains.', '1.1 Related Work There is a simple and natural parametrized set of truthful social choice functions called affine maximizers.', 'Roberts [10] showed that for functions with unrestricted domain, every truthful function is an affine maximizer, thus providing a parametrized representation for truthful functions with unrestricted domain.', 'There are many known examples of truthful functions over restricted domains that are not affine maximizers (see [1], [2], [4], [6] and [7]).', 'Each of these examples has a special structure and it seems plausible that there might be some mild restrictions on the class of all social choice functions such that all truthful functions obeying these restrictions are affine maximizers.', 'Lavi, Mu\"alem and Nisan [6] obtained a result in this direction by showing that for order-based domains, under certain technical assumptions, every truthful social choice function is almost an affine maximizer.', 'There are a number of results about truthfulness that can be viewed as providing obstruction characterizations, although the notion of obstruction is not explicitly discussed.', 'Call a social choice function i-local if its domain is ilocal and call it local if it is i-local for some i.', 'The social choice function f is truthful if and only if every local subfunction of f is truthful.', 'Rochet [11], Rozenshtrom [12] and Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] identified a necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness (see lemma 3 below) called the nonnegative cycle property.', 'But by restricting attention to interesting subclasses of social choice functions, one may hope to get simpler sets of obstructions for truthfulness within that class.', 'The condition of weak monotonicity mentioned earlier can be defined by a set of obstructions, each of which is a local function of domain size exactly 2.', 'Thus the results of Lavi, Mu\"alem and Nisan [6], and of Gui, Muller and Vohra [5] give a very simple set of obstructions for truthfulness within certain

should have to make more than one bid.', 'Thus, we need a bidding language that will allow the bidders to at least specify some bids more concisely.', 'We will specify a bidding language that only represents a subset of all possible bids, which can be described concisely.3 To introduce our bidding language, we will first describe the bidding function as a composition of two functions; then we will outline our assumptions on each of these functions.', 'First, because affine transformations do not affect utility functions in a fundamental way, it would be possi3 Of course, our bidding language can be trivially extended to allow for fully expressive bids, by also allowing bids from a fully expressive bidding language, in addition to the bids in our bidding language.', 'Second, a bidder could simply give a payment willingness function that is 0 everywhere, and have her utility be taken into account in deciding on the outcome, in spite of her not contributing anything.', 'HARDNESS OF CLEARING THE MARKET In this section, we will show that the clearing problem is completely inapproximable, even when every bidder\"s utility function is linear (with slope 0 or 1 in each charity\"s payments), each bidder cares either about at most two charities or about all charities equally, and each bidder\"s payment willingness function is a step function.', 'Every bid is a threshold bid; that is, every bidder\"s payment willingness function wj is a step function.', 'We also discuss in which special cases this formulation reduces to a linear programming (LP) formulation.', 'Because we only use binary variables when either a utility function ui j or a payment willingness function wj is not concave, it follows that if all of these are concave, our MIP formulation is simply a linear program-which can be solved in polynomial time.', 'Even if some of these functions are not concave, we can simply replace each such function by the smallest upper bounding concave function, and use the linear programming formulation to obtain an upper bound on the objectivewhich may be useful in a search formulation of the general problem.', 'WHY ONE CANNOT DO MUCH BETTER THAN LINEAR PROGRAMMING One may wonder if, for the special cases of the DONATIONCLEARING problem that can be solved in polynomial time with linear programming, there exist special purpose algorithms that are much faster than linear programming algorithms.', 'We give a reduction from (the decision variant of) the general linear programming problem to (the decision variant of) a special case of the DONATION-CLEARING problem (which can be solved in polynomial time using linear programming).', 'In this model, each bid bj has only linear ui j functions, and is a partially acceptable threshold bid (wj(u) = tj for u ≥ sj, otherwise wj(u) = utj sj ).', 'In a quasilinear bid, the bidder\"s payment willingness function is linear in utility: that is, wj = uj.', 'In most cases, quasilinearity is an unreasonable assumption: for example, usually bidders have a limited budget for donations, so that the payment willingness will stop increasing in utility after some point (or at least increase slower in the case of a softer budget constraint).', 'Nevertheless, quasilinearity may be a reasonable assumption in the case where the bidders are large organizations with large budgets, and the charities are a few small projects requiring relatively little money.', 'Thus, the bidders will never reach a high enough utility for their budget constraint (even when it is soft) to take effect, and thus a linear approximation of their payment willingness function is reasonable.', 'In this section, we will briefly discuss the options that mechanism design provides for the expressive charity donation problem.', '10.2 Mechanism design in the quasilinear setting There are four reasons why the mechanism design approach is likely to be most successful in the setting of quasilinear preferences.', 'First, historically, mechanism design has been been most successful when the quasilinear assumption could be made.', 'Second, because of this success, some very general mechanisms have been discovered for the quasilinear setting (for instance, the VCG mechanisms [24, 4, 10], or the dAGVA mechanism [6, 1]) which we could apply directly to the expressive charity donation problem.', '58 this setting, and thus we are less likely to run into computational trouble for the mechanism design problem.', 'Fourth, as we will show shortly, the quasilinearity assumption in some cases allows for decomposing the mechanism design problem over the charities (as it did for the simple clearing problem).', 'Moreover, in the quasilinear setting (unlike in the general setting), it makes sense to pursue social welfare (the sum of the utilities) as the objective, because now 1) units of utility correspond directly to units of money, so that we do not have the problem of the bidders arbitrarily scaling their utilities; and 2) it is no longer possible to give a payment willingness function of 0 while still affecting the donations through a utility function.', 'CONCLUSION We introduced a bidding language for expressing very general types of matching offers over multiple charities.', 'We gave a mixed-integer program formulation of the clearing problem, and showed that for concave bids (where utility functions and payment willingness function are concave), the program reduces to a linear program and can hence be solved in polynomial time.', 'We then showed that the clearing problem for a subclass of concave bids is at least as hard as the decision variant of linear programming, suggesting that we cannot do much better than a linear programming implementation for such bids.', 'For the quasilinear setting, we studied the mechanism design question of making the bidders report their preferences truthfully rather than strategically.', 'We also showed that even though the clearing problem decomposes over charities in the quasilinear setting, there may be benefits to linking the charities from a mechanism design standpoint.', 'Much crucial

Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305 rwporter@stanford.edu ABSTRACT For the problem of online real-time scheduling of jobs on a single processor, previous work presents matching upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio that can be achieved by a deterministic algorithm.', 'However, these results only apply to the non-strategic setting in which the jobs are released directly to the algorithm.', 'The agent can then delay releasing the job to the algorithm, inflate its length, and declare an arbitrary value and deadline for the job, while the center determines not only the schedule, but the payment of each agent.', 'For the resulting mechanism design problem (in which we also slightly strengthen an assumption from the non-strategic setting), we present a mechanism that addresses each incentive issue, while only increasing the competitive ratio by one.', 'The key challenge in this online setting is that the schedule must be constructed in real-time, even though nothing is known about a job until its release time.', 'One interpretation of this approach is as a game between the designer of the online algorithm and an adversary.', 'Then, the adversary observes the algorithm and selects the sequence of jobs that maximizes the competitive ratio: the ratio of the value of the jobs completed by an optimal oﬄine algorithm to the value of those completed by the online algorithm.', 'For k = 1, [4] presents a 4-competitive algorithm, and proves that this is a lower bound on the competitive ratio for deterministic algorithms.', 'Furthermore, sellers not only schedule jobs but also determine the amount that they charge buyers, an issue not addressed in the non-strategic setting.', 'Each agent now has four different ways in which it can manipulate the algorithm: it decides when to submit the job to the algorithm after the true release time, it can artificially inflate the length of the job, and it can declare an arbitrary value and deadline for the job.', 'The addition of self-interested agents moves the problem from the area of algorithm design to that of mechanism design [17], the science of crafting protocols for self-interested agents.', 'Recent years have seen much activity at the interface of computer science and mechanism design (see, e.g., [9, 18, 19]).', 'In our setting, a mechanism will take as input a job from each agent, and return a schedule for the jobs, and a payment to be made by each agent to the center.', 'A basic solution concept of mechanism design is incentive compatibility, which, in our setting, requires that it is always in each agent\"s best interests to immediately submit its job upon release, and to truthfully declare its value, length, and deadline.', 'Thus, in order to achieve a competitive ratio of c, an online mechanism must both be incentive compatible, and always achieve at least 1 c of the value that the optimal oﬄine mechanism achieves on the same sequence of jobs.', 'After introducing the incentive issues through an example, we formalize the mechanism design setting in Section 3.', 'In Section 4 we present our first main result, a ((1 + √ k)2 + 1)-competitive mechanism, and formally prove incentive compatibility and the competitive ratio.', 'Returning the general setting, we show in Section 5 that this competitive ratio is a lower bound for deterministic mechanisms that do not pay agents.', 'Each deadline is firm (or, hard), which means that no value is obtained for a job that is completed after its deadline.', 'The importance ratio is then defined to be ρmax ρmin , the maximal ratio of value densities between two jobs.', 'An online algorithm is a function f : Θ1 × .', 'An outcome o ∈ O is simply a schedule of jobs on the processor, recorded by the function S : + → {0, 1, . . . , N}, which maps each point in time to the active job, or to 0 if the processor is idle.', 'A job is abandoned if it cannot be completed by its deadline (formally, if di −t+ei(t) < li).', 'Since a job cannot be executed before its release time, the space of possible outcomes is restricted in that S(θ, t) = i implies ri ≤ t. Also, because the online algorithm must produce the schedule over time, without knowledge of future inputs, it must make the same decision at time t for inputs that are indistinguishable at this time.', 'In competitive analysis, an online algorithm is evaluated by comparing it against an optimal oﬄine algorithm.', 'An online algorithm f(·) is (strictly) c-competitive if there does not exist an input θ such that c · W(f(θ), θ) < W∗ (θ).', 'An algorithm that is c-competitive is also said to achieve a competitive ratio of c. We assume that there does not exist an overload period of infinite duration.', 'A period of time [ts , tf ] is overloaded if the sum of the lengths of the jobs whose release time and deadline both fall within the time period exceeds the duration of the interval (formally, if tf −ts ≤ i|(ts≤ri,di≤tf ) li).', 'Without such an assumption, it is not possible to achieve a finite competitive ratio [15].', 'TD1 (version 2) divides the schedule into intervals, each of which begins when the processor transitions from idle to busy (call this time tb ), and ends with the completion of a job.', 'The former records the latest deadline of a job that would be abandoned if the active job executes to completion (or, if no such job exists, the time that the active job will finish if it is not preempted).', 'For example, if job 2\"s deadline were declared as ˆd2 = 4.7, then it would have zero laxity at time 0.7.', '2 While we will not describe the significantly more complex In order to

deadline) and the payment it makes to the center.', 'The agent can declare an arbitrary deadline or value.', 'While in the non-strategic setting it was sufficient for the algorithm to know the upper bound k on the ratio ρmax ρmin , in the mechanism design setting we will strengthen this assumption so that the mechanism also knows ρmin (or, equivalently, the range [ρmin, ρmax] of possible value densities).3 Dover , we note that it is similar in its use of intervals and its preference for the active job.', 'The restriction on the schedule is now that S(ˆθ, t) = i implies ˆri ≤ t, to capture the fact that a job cannot be scheduled on the processor before it is declared to the mechanism.', 'ˆri = t and ˆli ≥ li if ∃i, ( ˆdi = t) ∧ (ei(ˆθ, t) ≥ li) then Completed job i is returned to agent i if ∃i, ( ˆdi = t) then Center sets and collects payment pi(ˆθ) from agent i 3.2 Mechanism Goals Our aim as mechanism designer is to maximize the value of completed jobs, subject to the constraints of incentive compatibility and individual rationality.', 'The condition for (dominant strategy) incentive compatibility is that for each agent i, regardless of its true type and of the declared types of all other agents, agent i cannot increase its utility by unilaterally changing its declaration.', 'A direct mechanism Γ satisfies incentive compatibility (IC) if ∀i, θi, θi, ˆθ−i : ui(g(θi, ˆθ−i), θi) ≥ ui(g(θi, ˆθ−i), θi) From an agent perspective, dominant strategies are desirable because the agent does not have to reason about either the strategies of the other agents or the distribution from the which other agent\"s types are drawn.', '4 A possible argument against the need for incentive compatibility is that an agent\"s lie may actually improve the schedule.', 'However, if an agent lies due to incorrect beliefs over the future input, then the lie could instead make the schedule the worse (for example, if job 3 were never released, then job 1 would have been unnecessarily abandoned).', 'A direct mechanism Γ satisfies individual rationality (IR) if ∀i, θi, ˆθ−i, ui(g(θi, ˆθ−i), θi) ≥ 0.', 'After providing some intuition as to why Γ1 satisfies individual rationality and incentive compatibility, we formally prove first these two properties and then the competitive ratio.', 'However, this would not affect our results, since executing a VCG mechanism (see, e.g., [17]) at time 0 both satisfies incentive compatibility and always maximizes social welfare.', 'The only possible effects of an inflated length are delaying the completion of the job and causing it to be abandoned, and the only possible effects of an earlier declared deadline are causing to be abandoned and causing it to be returned earlier (which has no effect on the agent\"s utility in our setting).', 'We can now combine the lemmas to show that no profitable deviation is possible.', '4.2 Proof of Competitive Ratio The proof of the competitive ratio, which makes use of techniques adapted from those used in [15], is also broken into lemmas.', 'Since we have also shown IR, in order to prove the competitive ratio it remains to bound the loss of social welfare against Γoffline.', 'As in [15], for each interval If , we give Γoffline the following gift: k times the amount of time in the range [tbegin f , tclose f ] that it does not schedule a job.', 'Using the fact that the way in which jobs are associated with the intervals partitions the entire set of jobs, we can show the competitive ratio by showing that Γ1 is (1+ √ k)2 +1 -competitive for each interval in the sequence (1, . . . , F).', 'Since Γ1 achieves vf , the competitive ratio holds.', 'If the setting satisfies these two conditions, then, by using Mechanism Γ2, we can achieve a competitive ratio of 5 (which is the same competitive ratio as Γ1 for the case of k = 1) without knowledge of ρmin and without the use of payments.', 'When k = 1, and each agent i cannot falsely declare li, Mechanism Γ2 satisfies individual rationality and incentive compatibility.', 'The proof of the lower bound uses an adversary argument similar to that used in [4] to show a lower bound of (1 +√ k)2 in the non-strategic setting, with the main novelty lying in the perturbation of the job sequence and the related incentive compatibility arguments.', '7 While payments are not required in this setting, Γ2 can be changed to collect a payments without affecting incentive compatibility by charging some fixed fraction of li for each job i that is completed.', 'There does not exist a deterministic online mechanism that satisfies NNP and that achieves a competitive ratio less than (1 + √ k)2 + 1.', 'Assume by contradiction that there exists a deterministic online mechanism Γ that satisfies NNP and that achieves a competitive ratio of c = (1 + √ k)2 + 1 − for some > 0 (and, by implication, satisfies IC and IR as well).', 'Since a competitive ratio of c implies a competitive ratio of c + x, for any x > 0, we assume without loss of generality that < 1.', 'The first major job has a release time of 0, and each major job i > 1 has a release time of ri = di−1 − δ, just before the deadline of the previous job.', 'Furthermore, agent f must be charged the same amount (that is, pf (θf , θ−f ) = pf (θ)), due to a similar incentive compatibility argument.', 'Then, at the original deadline of df , job f is not completed.', 'Because this new profile is indistinguishable from (θf , θ−f ) to Γ before time df , it must schedule jobs in the same way until df .', 'Then, in order to achieve the desired competitive ratio, it must execute job x continuously until its deadline, which is by construction at least as late as the new deadline df of job f. Thus, job f will not be completed, and, by IR and NNP, it must be the case that pf (θf , θ−f , θx) = 0 and uf (g(θf , θ−f , θx), θf ) = 0.', 'Substituting in for lf+1, the competitive ratio is then at least: k·( f h=1 lh−2δ)+lf+1+lf lf +δ = k·( f h=1 lh)−2k·δ+(c−1+α)·lf −k·( f h=1 lh)+lf lf +δ = c·lf +(α·lf −2k·δ) lf +δ ≥ c·lf +((ck+3k)δ−2k·δ) lf +δ > c.

are aware of that addresses the issue of incentive compatibility in a real-time system is [11], which considers several variants of a model in which the center allocates bandwidth to agents who declare both their value and their arrival time.', 'CONCLUSION In this paper, we considered an online scheduling domain for which algorithms with the best possible competitive ratio had been found, but for which new solutions were required when the setting is extended to include self-interested agents.', 'We presented a mechanism that is incentive compatible with respect to release time,

that never pays the agents.'], ['INTRODUCTION Many peer-to-peer (P2P) systems rely on cooperation among selfinterested users.', 'We adopt a game-theoretic approach in addressing this problem.', 'In particular, we use a prisoners\" dilemma model to capture the essential tension between individual and social utility, asymmetric payoff matrices to allow asymmetric transactions between peers, and a learning-based [14] population dynamic model to specify the behavior of individual peers, which can be changed continuously.', 'Therefore, we propose a family of scalable and robust incentive techniques, based upon a novel Reciprocative decision function, to address these challenges and provide different tradeoffs: • Discriminating Server Selection: Cooperation requires familiarity between entities either directly or indirectly.', 'We show that a maxflow-based algorithm that computes reputation subjectively promotes cooperation despite collusion among 1/3 of the population.', 'We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20].', 'We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.', 'The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25].', '• Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.', 'We describe the model in Section 2 and the reciprocative decision function in Section 3.', 'We then proceed to the incentive techniques in Section 4.', 'In Section 4.2, we describe collusion and demonstrate how subjective reputation mitigates it.', 'In Section 4.3, we present the problem of zero-cost identities and show how an adaptive stranger policy promotes persistent identities.', '2.2 Model To aid the development and study of the incentive schemes, in this section we present a model of the users\" behaviors.', 'Unfortunately, existing work either uses a specific asymmetric payoff matrix or only gives the general form for a symmetric one [4].', 'Instead, we use the Generalized Prisoner\"s Dilemma (GPD), which specifies the general form for an asymmetric payoff matrix that preserves the social dilemma.', 'RECIPROCATIVE DECISION FUNCTION In this section, we present the new decision function, Reciprocative, that is the basis for our incentive techniques.', 'In the absence of incentive techniques, 100% Defect users will quickly dominate the 100% Cooperate users and destroy cooperation in the system.', 'Entity i\"s generosity is simply the ratio of the service it provides to the

entity i\"s generosity relative to entity j\"s generosity.', 'More concretely, entity i\"s normalized generosity as perceived by entity j is gj(i) = g(i)/g(j).', 'We use this metric in all later

vulnerable to collusion or requiring centralized trust (e.g., trusted peers).', 'Despite the robustness of the maxflow algorithm to the simple form of collusion described previously, it still has vulnerabilities to more sophisticated attacks.', 'The other colluders can then exploit their reputation to receive service.', 'Since the mole is paying all of the cost of providing service and receiving none of the benefit, she has a strong incentive to stop colluding and try another strategy.', 'This forces the colluders to use mechanisms to maintain cooperation within their group, which may drive the cost of collusion to exceed the benefit.', 'Falsely claiming to receive service is the simple collusion attack described above.', 'Falsely claiming to have provided service or not to have received it allows an attacker to boost her own reputation and/or lower the reputation of another entity.', 'An entity may want to lower another entity\"s reputation in order to discourage others from selecting it and exclusively use its service.', 'In these cases, an attacker can only lower the reputation of the victim.', 'Unfortunately, a player cannot tell if a stranger is a whitewasher or a legitimate newcomer.', 'When we need to increment ps or cs, we generate the current values of ps and cs from k and r: cs = k/(1 + r) ps = cs ∗ r We then compute the new r as follows: r = (ps + 1)/cs

Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).', 'A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.', 'Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.', 'The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.', 'The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.', 'I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.', 'The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).', 'Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.', 'Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.', 'A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.', 'A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).', 'A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.', 'The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.', 'If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.', 'Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.', 'The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.', 'While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.', 'In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.', 'After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.', '. . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.', 'An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.', 'In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.', 'Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.', 'Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.', 'Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.', 'As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.', 'So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.', 'Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.', 'In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.', 'The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.', 'There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).', 'Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.', 'Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.', 'The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).', 'Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.', 'In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.', 'Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.', 'If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).', 'If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.', 'The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.', 'In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.', 'Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.', 'Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.', 'The patron\"s final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.', 'In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the market\"s close.', 'A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.', 'So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.', 'A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.', 'Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2.', 'Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.', 'At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).', 'However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market maker\"s sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.', 'There are many ways to formulate the price function.', 'Several natural price functions are outlined below; each is motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on price dynamics.', 'Even though technically an MSR exposes its patron to risk (i.e., a variable future payoff), the patron\"s maximum loss is bounded, so the distinction between a DPM and an MSR in terms of these three properties is more technical than practical.', 'The payoff for a wager depends both on the price at the time of the trade, and on the final payoff per share at the market\"s close.', '173 While an automated market maker always stands ready to accept buy orders, there is no corresponding market maker to accept sell orders.', 'Traders must sell to each other using a standard CDA mechanism, for example by posting an ask order at a price at or below the market maker\"s current ask price.', 'Traders can also always hedge-sell by purchasing shares in the opposite outcome from the market maker, thereby hedging their bet if not fully liquidating it.', '3.3 Redistribution rule In a standard pari-mutuel market, payoffs can be computed in either of two equivalent ways: (1) each winning $1 wager receives a refund of the initial $1 paid, plus an equal share of all losing wagers, or (2) each winning $1 wager receives an equal share of all wagers, winning or losing.', 'In a dynamic pari-mutuel market, because each dollar is not equally weighted, the two formulations are distinct, and lead to significantly different price functions and mechanisms, each with different potentially desirable properties.', 'Without loss of generality, I will analyze the market from the perspective of A, deriving prices and payoffs for A only.', 'The trader\"s per-share expected value for purchasing an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A is E[ shares] = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 E[ shares] = Pr(A) · E » M2 N1 ˛ ˛ ˛ ˛ A  − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 where is an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A, Pr(A) is the trader\"s belief in the probability of A, and p1 is the instantaneous price per share of A for an infinitesimal quantity of shares.', 'E[P1|A] is the trader\"s expectation of the payoff per share of A after the market closes and given that A occurs.', 'So, in order to determine the expected value of shares of A, the trader must estimate what he or she expects the payoff per share to be in the end (after the market closes) if A occurs.', 'This depends on the price function determining p1.', '4.1 Market probability As traders who believe that E[ shares of A]/ > 0 purchase shares of A and traders who believe that E[ shares of B]/ > 0 purchase shares of B, the prices p1 and p2 change according to a price function, as prescribed below.', 'For example, if market participants in aggregate felt that E[ shares]/ > 0, then there would be net demand for A, driving up the price of A until E[ shares]/ = 0.', '(3) That is, we assume that the current value for the payoff per share of A is the same as the expected final value of the payoff per share of A given that A occurs.', 'This is certainly true for the last (infinitesimal) wager before the market closes.', 'Regardless of whether (3) is true, each price function derived below implies a welldefined zero-sum game in which traders can play.', '4.2 Price functions A variety of price functions seem reasonable, each exhibiting various properties, and implying differing market probabilities.', '4.2.1 Price function I: Price of A equals payoff of B One natural price function to consider is to set the price per share of A equal to the payoff per share of B, and set the price per share of B equal to the payoff per share of A.', 'The relationship makes sense, since new information supporting A should encourage purchasing of shares A, driving up both the price of A and the payoff of B, and driving down the price of B and the payoff of A.', 'Note that p1 = dm/dn, the instantaneous price per share, and m = R n 0 p1(n)dn.', 'The instantaneous price per share as a function of n is p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2 .', 'The derivation of the price function p2(n) for B is analogous and the results are symmetric.', 'Then ask orders of 100 shares each at the appropriate price can be automatically placed by the market institution.', 'For example, the market institution can place an ask order for 100 shares at price m(100)/100, another ask order for 100 shares at price (m(200)−m(100))/100, a third ask for 100 shares at (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc.', 'In other words, the mechanism is a zero sum game, and the market institution takes no portion of the money.', 'This could be generalized so that the market institution always takes a certain amount, or a certain percent, or a certain amount per transaction, or a certain percent per transaction, before money in returned or redistributed.', 'Finally, note that the above price function is undefined when the amount bet or the number of shares are zero.', 'The initialization amounts could be funded as a subsidy from the market institution or a patron, which I\"ll call a seed wager, or from a portion of the fees charged, which I\"ll call an ante wager.', '4.2.2 Price function II: Price of A proportional to money on A A second price function can be derived by requiring the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered.', '(8) In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B.', 'Using Equation 8, along with (2) and (3), we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) We can solve for the instantaneous price as follows: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the implied cost function m as a function of the number n of shares purchased as follows: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 \" e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # .', '(11) From this we get the price function: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 .', 'If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B, which seems fairly natural.', 'So, if A occurs, shareholders of A lose their initial price paid, but receive P1 dollars per share owned; shareholders of B simply lose all money wagered.', 'Similarly, if B occurs, shareholders of B lose their initial price paid, but receive P2 dollars per share owned; shareholders of A lose all money wagered.', '(15) As before, we make the simplifying assumption (3) that the expected final payoff per share equals the current payoff per share.', '5.2 Price functions For the case where all money is distributed, the constraints (4) that keep the price of A equal to the payoff of B, and vice versa, do not lead to the derivation of a coherent price function.', 'A reasonable price function can be derived from the constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered.', 'In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B.', '176 Using Equations 3, 8, and 15 we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Interestingly, this is the same market probability derived in Section 4.2.1 for the case of losing-money redistribution with the constraints that the price of A equal the payoff of B and vice versa.', 'The instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares is: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m dollars, as follows: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m)  .', 'From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 +

of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B.', 'This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3).', '5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even.', 'The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.', 'On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.', 'Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.', 'One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.', 'Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market maker\"s price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even.', 'OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0.', 'For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.', 'Even though the market maker\"s price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market maker\"s price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.', 'I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.', 'Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but it\"s not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.', 'AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.', 'So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.', 'In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.', 'In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.', 'However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.', 'Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.', 'Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.', 'The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.', 'Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.', 'The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.', 'The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyer\"s price refunded).', 'The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.', 'The trader\"s loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.', 'Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket.', 'CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).',

combinatorial auctions and the problem of learning an unknown function from learning theory.', 'We show that learning algorithms can be used as a basis for preference elicitation algorithms.', 'The resulting elicitation algorithms perform a polynomial number of queries.', 'We also give conditions under which the resulting algorithms have polynomial communication.', 'Our conversion procedure allows us to generate combinatorial auction protocols from learning algorithms for polynomials, monotone DNF, and linear-threshold functions.', 'In particular, we obtain an algorithm that elicits XOR bids with polynomial communication.', 'There has been recent work exploring the links between the preference elicitation problem in combinatorial auctions and the problem of learning an unknown function from computational learning theory [5, 19].', 'In learning theory, the goal is to learn a function via various types of queries, such as What is the function\"s value on these inputs?', 'Though the goals of learning and preference elicitation differ somewhat, it is clear that these problems share similar structure, and it should come as no surprise that techniques from one field should be relevant to the other.', 'We show that any exact learning algorithm with membership and equivalence queries can be converted into a preference elicitation algorithm with value and demand queries.', 'The resulting elicitation algorithm guarantees elicitation in a polynomial number of value and demand queries.', 'Here we mean polynomial in the number of goods, agents, and the sizes of the agents\" valuation functions in a given encoding scheme.', 'Introducing this parameter also allows us to guarantee polynomial worst-case communication, which usually cannot be achieved in the number of goods and agents alone.', 'Finally, we use our conversion procedure to generate combinatorial auction protocols from learning algorithms for polynomials, monotone DNF, and linear-threshold functions.', 'Of course, a one-shot combinatorial auction where agents provide their entire valuation functions at once would also have polynomial communication in the size of the agents\" valuations, and only require one query.', 'Our focus is on the time and communication complexity of preference elicitation regardless of incentive constraints, and on the relationship between the complexities of learning and preference elicitation.', '[19] consider the problem of learning restricted classes of valuation functions which can be represented using read-once formulas and Toolbox DNF.', 'Since their work is also grounded in learning theory, they allow dependence on the size of the target valuation as we do (though read-once valuations can always be succinctly represented anyway).', '[5] provide results relating the complexities of query learning and preference elicitation.', 'In contrast, our work shows that given a more general (yet still quite standard) version of demand query than the type they consider, the complexity of preference elicitation is no greater than the complexity of learning.', 'This is in fact the basic framework of learning theory.', 'THE MODELS 2.1 Query Learning The query learning model we consider here is called exact learning from membership and equivalence queries, introduced by Angluin [2].', 'In this model the learning algorithm\"s objective is to exactly identify an unknown target function f : X → Y via queries to an oracle.', 'Upon termination, the manifest hypothesis of a correct learning algorithm satisfies ˜f(x) = f(x) for all x ∈ X.', 'Or it may be encoded as the polynomial 2x1 · · · xm, which is much more succinct.', 'The choice of encoding may thus have a significant impact on the time and space requirements of the learning algorithm.', 'The size of a polynomial can be defined as the number of non-zero coefficients in the polynomial, for example.', 'We are interested in efficient learning algorithms.', 'The representation class C is polynomialquery exactly learnable from membership and equivalence queries if there is a fixed polynomial p(·, ·) and an algorithm L with access to membership and equivalence queries of an oracle such that for any target function f ∈ C, L outputs after at most p(size(f), m) queries a function ˜f ∈ C such that ˜f(x) = f(x) for all instances x.', 'Similarly, the representation class C is efficiently exactly learnable from membership and equivalence queries if the algorithm L outputs a correct hypothesis in time p(size(f), m), for some fixed polynomial p(·, ·).', 'Since the target function must be reconstructed, we also necessarily allow polynomial dependence on size(f).', 'As in the learning theory setting, we will usually only refer to bidding languages rather than valuation classes, because the corresponding valuation classes will then be implied.', 'To make an analogy to computational learning theory, we assume that all representation classes considered are polynomially interpretable [11], meaning that the value of a bundle may be computed in polynomial time given the valuation function\"s representation.', 'More formally, a representation class (bidding language) C is polynomially interpretable if there exists an algorithm that given as input some v ∈ C and an instance x ∈ X computes the value v(x) in time q(size(v), m), for some fixed polynomial q(·, ·).2 In the intermediate rounds of an (iterative) auction, the auctioneer will have elicited information about the agents\" valuation functions via various types of queries.', 'The goal in the preference elicitation problem is to construct a set of manifest valuations such that: arg max (S1,...,Sn)∈Γ i∈N ˜vi(Si) ⊆ arg max (S1,...,Sn)∈Γ i∈N vi(Si) That is, the manifest valuations provide enough information to compute an allocation that is optimal with respect to the true valuations.', '2 This excludes OR∗ , assuming P = NP, because interpreting bids from this language is NP-hard by reduction from weighted set-packing, and there is no well-studied representation class in learning theory that is clearly analogous to OR∗ .', '3 This view of iterative auctions is meant to parallel the learning setting.', 'Two typical queries used in preference elicitation are value and demand queries.', 'We make the following definitions to parallel the query learning setting and to simplify the statements of later results: Definition 2.', '. . , Vn can be polynomial-query elicited from value and demand queries if there is a fixed polynomial p(·, ·) and an

learning definition.', 'Also, an efficient elicitation algorithm is polynomial communication, rather than polynomial time.', 'It is thus unreasonable to require polynomial time in the definition of an

Science Department Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305 ABSTRACT Motivated by the rise of online auctions and their relative lack of security, this paper analyzes two forms of cheating in sealed-bid auctions.', 'The first type of cheating we consider occurs when the seller spies on the bids of a second-price auction and then inserts a fake bid in order to increase the payment of the winning bidder.', 'In the second type, a bidder cheats in a first-price auction by examining the competing bids before deciding on his own bid.', 'In both cases, we derive equilibrium strategies when bidders are aware of the possibility of cheating.', 'INTRODUCTION Among the types of auctions commonly used in practice, sealed-bid auctions are a good practical choice because they require little communication and can be completed almost instantly.', 'However, sealed-bid auctions do require that the bids be kept private until the auction clears.', 'At an auction house, with all participants present, it is difficult to examine a bid that another bidder gave directly to the auctioneer.', 'However, in an online auction the auctioneer is often little more than a server with questionable security; and, since all participants are in different locations, one can anonymously attempt to break into the server.', 'In this paper, we present a game theoretic analysis of how bidders should behave when they are aware of the possibility of cheating that is based on knowledge of the bids.', 'We investigate this type of cheating along two dimensions: whether it is the auctioneer or a bidder who cheats, and which variant (either first or second-price) of the sealed-bid auction is used.', 'In our setting, there is no incentive for the seller to submit a shill bid in a first price auction, because doing so would either cancel the auction or not affect the payment of the winning bidder.', 'A seller can profitably cheat in a second-price auction by looking at the bids before the auction clears and submitting an extra bid.', 'This possibility was pointed out as early as the seminal paper [12] that introduced this type of auction.', 'For example, if the bidders in an eBay auction each use a proxy bidder (essentially creating a second-price auction), then the seller may be able to break into eBay\"s server, observe the maximum price that a bidder is willing to pay, and then extract this price by submitting a shill bid just below it using a false identity.', 'We assume that there is no chance that the seller will be caught when it cheats.', 'We assume that each bidder knows the probability with which the seller will cheat.', 'Possible motivation for this knowledge could be a recently published expos´e on seller cheating in eBay auctions.', 'In this setting, we derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for the case in which each bidder\"s value for the good is independently drawn from a common distribution (with no further assumptions except for continuity and differentiability).', 'But why should the seller have all the fun?', 'To decide how much to shave his bid, he must trade off the probability of winning the auction against how much he will pay if he does win.', 'In this setting, our goal is to derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for a non-cheating bidder who is aware of the possibility that he is competing against cheating bidders.', 'When bidder values are drawn from the commonly-analyzed uniform distribution, we show the counterintuitive result that the possibility of other bidders cheating has no effect on the equilibrium strategy of an honest bidder.', 'This result is then extended to show the robustness of the equilibrium of a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating.', 'We conclude this section by exploring other distributions, including some in which the presence of cheating bidders actually induces an honest bidder to lower its bid.', 'In Section 2 we formalize the setting and present our results for the case of a seller cheating in a second price auction.', 'Section 3 covers the case of bidders cheating in a first-price auction.', 'In Section 4, we quantify the effects that the possibility of cheating has on an honest seller in the two settings.', 'We discuss related work, including other forms of cheating in auctions, in Section 5, before concluding with Section 6.', 'SECOND-PRICE AUCTION, CHEATING SELLER In this section, we consider a second-price auction in which the seller may cheat by inserting a shill bid after observing all of the bids.', 'The formulation for this section will be largely reused in the following section on bidders cheating in a first-price auction.', 'While no prior knowledge of game theory or auction theory is assumed, good introductions can be found in [2] and [6], respectively.', 'Each agent has a type θi ∈ [0, 1], drawn from a continuous range, which represents the agent\"s value for the good being auctioned.2 Each agent\"s type is independently drawn from a cumulative distribution function (cdf ) F over [0, 1], where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.', 'Each agent knows its own type θi, but only the distribution over the possible types of the other agents.', 'A bidding strategy for an agent bi : [0, 1] → [0, 1] maps its type to its bid.3 Let θ = (θ1, · · · , θn) be the vector of types for all agents, and θ−i = (θ1, · · · , θi−1, θi+1, · · · θn) be the vector of all types except for that of agent i.', 'the bid of agent i as b−i(θ−i).', 'An agent obviously wins the auction if its bid is greater than all other bids, but ties complicate the formulation.', 'Fortunately, we can ignore the case of ties in this paper because our continuity assumption will make them a zero probability event in equilibrium.', 'We assume that the seller does not set a reserve price.4 If the seller does not cheat, then the winning agent pays the highest bid by another agent.', 'On the other hand, if the seller does cheat, then the winning agent will pay its bid, since we assume that a cheating seller would take full advantage of its power.', 'Let the indicator variable µc be 1 if the seller cheats, and 0 otherwise.', 'The probability that the seller cheats, Pc , is known by all agents.5 We can then write the payment of the winning agent as follows.', 'The utility for agent i is zero if it does not win the auction, and the difference between its valuation and its price if it does.', 'ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = µ bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − pi(b(θ), µc ) (2) We will be concerned with the expected utility of an agent, with the expectation taken over the types of the other agents and over whether or not the seller cheats.', 'By pushing the expectation inward so that it is only over the price (conditioned on the agent winning the auction), we can write the expected utility as: Eθ−i,µc [ui(b(θ), µc , θi)] = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (3) We assume that all agents are rational, expected utility maximizers.', 'A vector of bidding strategies b∗ is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium if for each agent i and each possible type θi, agent i cannot increase its expected utility by using an alternate bidding strategy bi, holding the bidding strategies for all other agents fixed.', '4 This simplifies the analysis, but all of our results can be applied to the case in which the seller announces a reserve price before the auction begins.', 'In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) (5) It is useful to consider the extreme points of Pc .', 'Setting Pc = 1 yields the correct result for a first-price auction (see, e.g., [10]).', 'In the case of Pc = 0, this solution is not defined.', 'However, in the limit, bi(θi) approaches θi as Pc approaches 0, which is what we expect as the auction approaches a standard second-price auction.', 'Consider a probabilistic sealed-bid auction in which the seller is honest, but the price paid by the winning agent is determined by a weighted coin flip: with probability Pc it is his bid, and with probability 1 − Pc it is the second-highest bid.', 'Furthermore, the fact that this probabilistic auction satisfies the properties required for the Revenue Equivalence Theorem (see, e.g., [2]) provides a way to verify that the bidding strategy in Equation 5 is the symmetric equilibrium of this auction (see the alternative proof of Theorem 1 in the appendix).', 'In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , and F(θi) = θi, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = N − 1 N − 1 + Pc θi (6) This equilibrium bidding strategy, parameterized by Pc , can be viewed as an interpolation between two well-known results.', 'When Pc = 0 the bidding strategy is now welldefined (each agent bids its true type), while when Pc = 1 we get the correct result for a first-price auction: each agent bids according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.', 'FIRST-PRICE AUCTION, CHEATING AGENTS We now consider the case in which the seller is honest, but there is a chance that agents will cheat and examine the other bids before submitting their own (or, alternatively, they will revise their bid before the auction clears).', 'Since this type of cheating is pointless in a second-price auction, we only analyze the case of a first-price auction.', 'This equation will be useful for the analysis the uniform distribution, in which we show that the possibility of cheating agents does not change the equilibrium strategy of honest agents.', 'Furthermore, we find that for other distributions overbidding actually induces a competing agent to shave more off of its bid.', '3.1 Formulation It is clear that if a single agent is cheating, he will bid (up to his valuation) the minimum amount necessary to win the auction.', 'One could imagine a scenario similar to an English auction, in which all cheating agents keep revising their bids until all but one cheater wants the good at the current winning bid.', 'However, we are only concerned with how an honest agent should bid given that it is aware of the possibility of cheating.', 'Thus, it suffices for an honest agent to know that it will win the auction if and only if its bid exceeds every other honest agent\"s bid and every cheating agent\"s type.', 'In the first stage, each agent\"s payment rule is determined.', 'With probability Pa , the agent will pay the second highest bid if it wins the auction (essentially, he is a cheater), and otherwise it will have to pay its bid.', '. . , µan ), where µai = 1 denotes that agent i pays the second highest bid.', 'Each agent knows the probability Pa , but does not know the payment rule for all other agents.', 'Otherwise, this auction is a standard, sealed-bid auction.', 'The expression for the utility of an honest agent in this discriminatory auction is as follows.', 'ui(b(θ), µa , θi) = θi − bi(θ) · j=i µaj · µ bi(θi) > θj + (1 − µaj ) · µ bi(θi) > bj(θj) (7) 3.2 Equilibrium Our goal is to find the equilibrium in which all cheating agents use their dominant strategy of bidding truthfully and honest agents bid according to a symmetric bidding strategy.', 'In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy that is a fixed point of the following equation: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) (N−1) (8) 78 3.3 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Since we could not solve Equation 8 in the general case, we can only see how the possibility of cheating affects the equilibrium bidding strategy for particular instances of F(·).', 'Recall the logic behind the symmetric equilibrium strategy in a first-price auction without cheating: bi(θi) = N−1 N θi is the optimal tradeoff between increasing the probability of winning and decreasing the price paid upon winning, given that the other agents are bidding according to the same strategy.', 'Since in the current setting the cheating agents do not shave their bid at all and thus decrease an honest agent\"s probability of winning (while obviously not affecting the price that an honest agent pays if he wins), it is natural to expect that an honest agent should compensate by increasing his bid.', 'In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , and F(θi) = θi, it is a BayesNash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.', 'This result suggests that the equilibrium of a first-price auction is particularly robust when types are drawn from the uniform distribution, since the best response is unaffected by deviations of the other agents to the strategy of always bidding their type.', 'In fact, as long as all other agents shave their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no greater than 1 N , it is still a best response for the remaining agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy.', 'In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θi, if each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) = N−1+αj N θj, where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.', 'Obviously, these strategy profiles are not equilibria (unless each αj = 0), because each agent j has an incentive to set αj = 0.', 'The point of this theorem is that a wide range of possible beliefs that an agent can hold about the strategies of the other agents will all lead him to play the equilibrium strategy.', 'It is important to note, though, that while this equilibrium is robust against arbitrary deviations to strategies that shave less, it is not robust to even a single agent shaving more off of its bid.', 'In fact, if we take any strategy profile consistent with the conditions of Theorem 5 and change a single agent j\"s strategy so that its corresponding αj is negative, then agent i\"s best response is to shave more than 1 N off of its bid.', 'However, taking a simple linear combination of two such distributions to produce F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 yields a distribution in which an agent should actually shave its bid more when other agents shave their bids less.', 'In the example we present for this distribution (with the details in the appendix), there are only two players and the deviation by one agent is to bid his type.', 'In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 and N = 2, if agent 2 always bids its type (b2(θ2) = θ2), then, for all θ1 > 0, agent 1\"s best response bidding strategy is strictly less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric equilibrium.', 'It is certainly the case that distributions can be found that support the intuition given above that agents should shave their bid less when other agents are doing likewise.', 'Unfortunately, we were not able to find such a condition, in part because the integral in the symmetric bidding strategy of a first-price auction cannot be solved without knowing F(·) (or at least some restrictions on it).', 'REVENUE LOSS FOR AN HONEST SELLER In both of the settings we covered, an honest seller suffers a loss in expected revenue due to the possibility of cheating.', 'Although this is as far as we will take the analysis, it could be applied to more general settings, in which the seller could, for example, choose the market in which he sells his good or pay a trusted third party to oversee the auction.', 'In a second-price auction in which the seller may cheat, an honest seller suffers due the fact that the agents will shave their bids.', 'For the case in which agent types are drawn from the uniform distribution, every agent will shave its bid by P c N−1+P c , which is thus also the fraction by which an honest seller\"s revenue decreases due to the possibility of cheating.', 'Analysis of the case of a first-price auction in which agents may cheat is not so straightforward.', 'If Pa = 1 (each agent cheats with certainty), then we simply have a second-price auction, and the seller\"s expected revenue will be unchanged.', 'Again considering the uniform distribution for agent types, it is not surprising that Pa = 1 2 causes the seller to lose 79 the most revenue.', 'However, even in this worst case, the percentage of expected revenue lost is significantly less than it is for the second-price auction in which Pc = 1 2 , as shown in Table 1.6 It turns out that setting Pc = 0.2 would make the expected loss of these two settings comparable.', 'While this comparison between the settings is unlikely to be useful for a seller, it is interesting to note that agent suspicions of possible cheating by the seller are in some sense worse than agents actually cheating themselves.', 'Percentage of Revenue lost for an Honest Seller Agents Second-Price Auction First-Price Auction (Pc = 0.5) (Pa = 0.5) 2 33 12 5 11 4.0 10 5.3

paper.', 'For example, a bidder\"s only source of information about N could be a counter that the seller places on the auction webpage, or a statement by the seller about the number of potential bidders who have indicated that they will participate.', 'In these cases, the seller could arbitrarily manipulate the perceived N. In a first-price auction, the seller obviously has an incentive to increase the perceived value of N in order to induce agents to bid closer to their true valuation.', 'However, if agents are aware that the seller has this power, then any communication about N to the agents is cheap talk, and furthermore is not credible.', 'If we make the natural assumption of a common prior, then the setting reduces to the one tackled by [5], which derived the equilibrium bidding strategies of a first-price auction when the number of bidders is drawn from a known distribution but not revealed to any of the bidders.', 'Of course, instead of assuming that the seller can always exploit this power, we could assume that it can only do so with some probability that is known by the agents.', 'The analysis would then proceed in a similar manner as that of our cheating seller model.', 'The other interesting case of this form of cheating is by bidders in a first-price auction.', 'Other types of collusion are of course related to the general topic of cheating in auctions.', 'The work most closely related to our first setting is [11], which also presents a model in which the seller may cheat in a second-price auction.', 'In their setting, the seller is a participant in the Bayesian game who decides between running a first-price auction (where profitable cheating is never possible) or second-price auction.', 'The seller makes this choice after observing his type, which is his probability of having the opportunity and willingness to cheat in a second-price auction.', 'It is shown that, in equilibrium, only a seller with the maximum probability of cheating would ever choose to run a second-price auction.', 'Our work differs in that we focus on the agents\" strategies in a second-price auction for a given probability of cheating by the seller.', 'An area of related work that can be seen as complementary to ours is that of secure auctions, which takes the point of view of an auction designer.', 'CONCLUSION In this paper we presented the equilibria of sealed-bid auctions in which cheating is possible.', 'The results for the case of a cheating seller in a second-price auction allow us to relate the two auctions as endpoints along a continuum.', 'The case of agents cheating in a first-price auction showed the robustness of the first-price auction equilibrium when agent types are drawn from the uniform distribution.', 'Finally, results from both of our settings allowed us to quantify the expected loss in revenue for a seller due to the possibility of cheating.', 'Two models of bid-taker cheating in vickrey auctions.', 'In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) (5) Proof.', 'That is, it takes a bid for agent i as input and returns the type θi that induced this bid.', 'Recall Equation 3: Eθ−i,µc ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) The probability that a single other bid is below that of agent i is equal to the cdf at the type that would induce a bid equal to that of agent i, which is formally written as F(Φi(bi(θi))).', 'Since all agents are independent, the probability that all other bids are below agent i\"s is simply this term raised the (N − 1)-th power.', 'We used the solution for the first-price auction (see, e.g., [10]) as our starting point to find the answer: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) (12) To verify the solution, we first take its derivative: bi(θi) = 1− F(2· N−1 P c ) (θi) − N−1 P c · F( N−1 P c −1) (θi) · f(θi) · θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F(2· N−1 P c ) (θi) This simplifies to: bi(θi) = N−1 P c · f(θi) · θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c +1) (θi) We then plug this derivative into the equation we derived (11): bi(θi) = θi − Pc · F(θi) · N−1 P c · f(θi) · θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx (N − 1) · f(θi) · F( N−1 P c +1) (θi) Cancelling terms yields Equation 12, verifying that our guessed solution is correct.', 'Alternative Proof of Theorem 1: The following proof uses the Revenue Equivalence Theorem (RET) and the probabilistic auction given as an interpretation of our cheating seller setting.', 'In a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating, the expected payment for an agent with type θi is simply the product of its bid and the probability that this bid is the highest.', 'For the symmetric equilibrium, this is equal to: F(N−1) (θi) · θi − θi 0 F(N−1) (x)dx F(N−1)(θi) For our probabilistic auction, the expected payment of the winning agent is a weighted average of its bid and the second highest bid.', 'Thus, we can verify our equilibrium bidding strategy by showing that the expected payment in the two auctions is equal.', 'Since the expected payment is zero at θi = 0 for both functions, it suffices to verify that the derivatives of the expected payment functions with respect to θi are equal, for an arbitrary value θi.', 'In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , and F(θi) = θi, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = N − 1 N − 1 + Pc θi (6) Proof.', 'In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy that is a fixed point of the following equation: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) (N−1) (8) Proof.', 'When simplifying the expectation of this setting\"s utility equation (7), we use the fact that the probability that agent i will have a higher bid than another honest agent is still F(Φi(bi(θi))), while the probability is F(bi(θi)) if the other agent cheats.', 'The probability that agent i beats a single other agent is then a weighted average of these two probabilities.', 'Thus, we can write agent i\"s expected utility as: Eθ−i,µa ui(b(θ), µa , θi) = θi − bi(θi) · Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(Φi(bi(θi))) N−1 As before, to find the equilibrium bi(θi), we take the derivative and set it to zero: 0 = θi − bi(θi) · (N − 1)· Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(Φi(bi(θi))) N−2 · Pa · f(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · f(Φi(bi(θi))) · Φi(bi(θi)) − Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(Φi(bi(θi))) N−1 Applying the equations Φi(bi(θi)) = 1 bi(θi) and Φi(bi(θi)) = θi, and dividing through, produces: 0 = θi − bi(θi) · (N − 1)· Pa · f(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · f(θi) · 1 bi(θi) − Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(θi) Rearranging terms yields: bi(θi) = θi − Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) · bi(θi) (N − 1) · Pa · f(bi(θi)) · bi(θi) + (1 − Pa) · f(θi) (13) In this setting, because we leave F(·) unspecified, we cannot present a closed form solution.', 'In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , and F(θi) = θi, it is a BayesNash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.', 'In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θi, if each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) = N−1+αj N θj, where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.', 'The probability that agent i has a higher bid than a single agent j is F(Φj(bi(θi))) = N N−1+αj bi(θi).', 'Note, however, that since Φj(·) is only defined over the range [0, bj(1)], it must be the case that bi(1) ≤ bj(1), which is why αj ≥ 0 is necessary, in addition to being sufficient.', 'The expected utility for agent i can then be written as: Eθ−i ui(b(θ), θi) = Πj=i N N − 1 + αj bi(θi) · θi −bi(θ) = Πj=i N N − 1 + αj · θi· bi(θi) (N−1) − bi(θi) N Taking the derivative with respect to bi(θi), setting it to zero, and dividing out Πj=i N N−1+αj yields: 0 = θi · (N − 1) · bi(θi) (N−2) − N · bi(θi) (N−1) This simplifies to the solution: bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.', 'Full Version of Example 1: In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 and N = 2, if agent 2 always bids its type (b2(θ2) = θ2), then, for all θ1 > 0, agent 1\"s best response bidding strategy is strictly less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric equilibrium.', 'After calculating the symmetric equilibrium in which both agents shave their bid by the same amount, we find the best response to an agent who instead does not shave its bid.', 'To find the symmetric equilibrium bidding strategy, we instantiate N = 2 in the general formula the equation found in [10], plug in F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 , and simplify: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F(x)dx F(θi) = θi− 1 2 · θi 0 (x2 + x)dx 1 2 · (θ2 i + θi) = θi− 1 3 θ3 i + 1 2 θ2 i θ2 i + θi = 2 3 θ2 i + 1 2 θi θi + 1 We now derive the best response for agent 1 to the strategy b2(θ2) = θ2, denoting the best response strategy b∗ 1(θ1) to distinguish it from the symmetric case.', 'The probability of agent 1 winning is F(b∗ 1(θ1)), which is the probability that agent 2\"s type is less than agent 1\"s bid.', 'Thus, agent 1\"s expected utility is: Eθ2 ui((b∗ 1(θ1), b2(θ2)), θ1) = F(b∗ 1(θ1)) · θ1 − b∗ 1(θ1) = (b∗ 1(θ1))2 + b∗ 1(θ1) 2 · θ1 − b∗ 1(θ1) Taking the derivative with respect to b∗ 1(θ1), setting it to zero, and then rearranging terms gives us: 0 = 1 2 · 2 · b∗ 1(θ1) · θ1 − 3 · (b∗ 1(θ1))2 + θ1 − 2 · b∗ 1(θ1) 0 = 3 · (b∗ 1(θ1))2 + (2 − 2 · θ1) · b∗ 1(θ1) − θ1 Of the two solutions of this equation, one always produces a negative bid.']]\n"
